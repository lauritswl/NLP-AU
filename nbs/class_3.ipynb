       " 'Post navigation\\n\\nAn Interview With The Bollocks (Kenny Williams)\\n\\nI’m a fan of simple titles for things. The words will do the talking know what I mean? Flashy titles tends to mean pish writing if ye ask me. So with the interviews its always just “An Interview With *insert name*” and thats that. Had tae make a slight exception here because this is an interview with Kenny Williams, and Kenny is the fuckin bollocks. No question. Kenny is one of the fastest rising stars in Scottish Wrestling, and a fan favourite everywhere he goes because he gets it. He knows what folk want from a wrestling show. They want entertainment. They want cunts knocking their pan in to provide that entertainment, and some of them even want the guys providing said entertainment to have more product in their hair than a burd in a beauty pageant. Kenny Williams has it all. When he first debuted alongside Christopher in ICW, my first thought was “aww whit, ANOTHER one of these wee fannies?” but we soon seen Kenny was nae joke. Him and Christopher’s match with the NAK at ICWs Maryhill show was when most of us realised Kenny was legit. Kenny is the bollocks.\\n\\nThe bollocks took some time out of his busy schedule of being a globetrotting professional sha….I mean wrestler, to answer a few questions for his pals at Snapmare Necks (thats us btw) so you should probably go right ahead and read that shit. Its waiting for ye. Down there. See it? Just below this? Thats the one. In amongst it.\\n\\n1. You’re one of the newer faces in Scottish Wrestling, can you tell us a bit about how you got started and who/what influenced your decision to give wrestling a go?\\n\\nGenerally I’ve always loved the ‘Rasslin! But it wasn’t untill I was about 18 that I decided to give it a go. I had gotten into Law at university straight from school but I only last about 6 weeks as I realised it just wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. I fannyed about for a few months after that and at the beginning of 2012 I decided to give something that I had always loved a bash. I searched about for local schools and luckily a PBW Academy had just opened in the area that I love of Airdrie. I’ve been hooked ever since then!\\n\\n2. The “Kenny is the bollocks” chant at ICW has been going for a while, with your popularity in the company seemingly sky high. How much do you enjoy working in front of those wild crowds, particularly when they seem to have taken you to their hearts so quickly?\\n\\nI find it ridiculous anytime that chant starts up when I come out. It’s so humbling and overwhelming and I appreciate who ever started it because I’m hopefully going to sell lots of t-shirts with that printed on it! Working for ICW is a tremendous experience and I’ve been so lucky with the situations that have arisen for me. Being part of Team CK the fans never really got to see the full potential that we had as a duo and so when Christopher decided to call it a day I was disheartened by it all. However, when I finally got a chance to showcase what I could do in the ring on a singles level, with one of the best in the country, Lionheart, that’s when it felt like everything clicked with the fans. They didn’t just see some wee guy with a quiff and pair of skinny jeans. They saw a wee guy with a quiff and skinny jeans that had a bit of fight and determination in him. Since then I’ve been riding on a wave of momentum that the fans have created with this chant! And I’m so grateful to every person who starts that up when I walk out with those dafties in the Kennedy Administration!\\n\\n3. You’re part of a stable with a bit of everything at the moment with the “Kennedy Administration” in ICW, how much are you enjoying being involved in that? And with you not getting on particularly well with your stable mates, are there any plans in place to toe their baws any time soon?\\n\\nI’m finding it really fun because it’s a different dynamic than any of the other factions in ICW as it’s a heel group with a fan favourite trapped in it. And luckily/unluckily I’m that fan favourite so it’s funny to see how harshly the fans react to James R Kennedy when he starts hurling abuse at me. The fans anticipation for me to finally skud one of them is definitely growing but its like being caught between a rock and a hard place as I can’t risk having my contract terminated by Kennedy.\\n\\n4. You recently made your debut for SWA, in a belter of a match against Lewis Girvan, and you’re a regular with PBW. How do you enjoy the family friendly shows compared to the adult orientated ones?\\n\\nDespite the obvious differences in content of the shows, I feel that working any wrestling show the fans are all there for the same reason, to see top quality wrestling that Scotland has become a custom to. So I enjoy the two types equally because I’m getting to do what I love to do and if I’m doing it well I’m hopefully entertaining the fans who have made the effort to come out and support their local wrestling promotion.\\n\\n5. Do you have a match that you’d rank as your best so far?\\n\\nI’m to critical of myself to cite a best match so instead ill list some favourites and plug some of the youtube footage I have\\nPBW- vs Zack Sabre Jr.. A match that came out of pure circumstance and I was a last-minute substitute. Working Zack was a ridiculous experience as he is just a different class of performer.\\n\\nPBW – Kenny Williams vs Zack Sabre Jr\\n\\nPBW – vs Liam Thompson… Got to main event in my hometown and fool friends and family into thinking I had won the title. Was a crazy atmosphere and by far one of my favourite nights in wrestling\\n\\nPBW – Liam Thomson vs Kenny Williams (PBW Title Match)\\n\\nICW – vs Lionheart… Like I said this match really helped establish me as a singles competitor and a fan favourite and it took a lot of folk by surprise.\\nBCW – vs Kid Fite… Got to main event a show with a guy who was a major part of my training so it meant a lot to me. Also happened to be a year after I debuted so it was full of sentimentalities!\\n\\n(Not the match Kenny mentioned, as its been taken off youtube, but still a cracker of a match between these two)\\n\\nSSW – Kid Fite vs Kenny Williams\\n\\n6. Favourite wrestler? Either currently or all-time…or both if ye fancy.\\n\\nCurrently my favourite wrestler would have to be Bray Wyatt. He’s so captivating, it’s like watching a scene from a movie when he cuts a promo and his matches are always so different from what’s going on in the rest of the show. Of all time it has to be Shawn Michaels. I got into wrestling when he came back all born again and drug free so I got HBK when he was at his healthiest and churning out some of his best matches.\\n\\n7. You’re confirmed for ICWs latest project, a show mainly geared towards the younger talents called “Spacebaws – A New Hope”. Are you excited to play a prominent role on this show?\\n\\nI have no idea what I’ll be doing on this show I have to admit. I’m on the poster so I’m on the show! I can assure you though this will be a night not to miss! Cramming a show full of hungry young talent in an over 18s environment is a recipe for mayhem because there will be a level of one up manship between every person on that show to prove to Mark Dallas why they deserve to be part of ICW’s regular roster. I’ll be doing the exact same to prove why I deserve to be at the level I’ve been fortunate enough to get to so quickly so I’d advise folk to get a ticket before they disappear!\\n\\n8. Earliest wrestling memory?\\n\\nWaking up early on a Saturday to watch Smackdown on Sky 1 and asking my cousin to VHS record any PPV he would end up paying for. Think the first one I can remember watching back with him was Wrestlemania 17.\\n\\n9. You recently worked on the PBW Academy Attacks show in Coatbridge, where many PBW Academy students made their debuts. Are there any in particular that standout in your opinion?\\n\\nThe PBW Academy is amongst the top wrestling schools in Britain. It has 3 branches (Airdrie/Barrhead/Greenock) and has churned out some of the best young talent on the scene just now such as Noam Dar, Andy Wild, Kay Lee Ray, Davey Blaze, TJ Rage, Saqib Ali and more. To say I picked a great school to learn is an understatement. The talent coming through just now including myself have had a lot of opportunities to showcase there talents and the academy attack shows are definitely one of the chance to shine in front of a crowd and also in front of certain promoters. It has opened doors for a lot of younger guys who have stood out such as Lou King Sharp, Brendan Cooper, Tommy Marx, Aaron Echo and more. Lou King Sharp in particular has started to make a name for himself debuting on the first Academy Attack show against myself and in the last year he has went on to wrestle for Pro Wrestling Elite, British Championship Wrestling and is also confirmed for ICW Space Baws. He is so unique with his character work and I’m pleased he is getting the opportunities he is getting.\\n\\n10. You made your PCW debut recently, how was the PCW experience and has this led to further opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland?\\n\\nWorking for PCW was a cool experience. I was given a shot in there annual Rumble and managed to last about 15 minutes which wasn’t so bad for the skinniest guy in the match. I’d love to work there again but in less crowded match so I could really show the fans down there exactly what I can bring to the table. Other opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland have come up recently with my debut in May for Kamikaze Pro which is a great promotion down in Birmingham. I’m also set to debut in Ireland at the end of the year. Also luckily for me I’ve had the chance to wrestle outside of Scotland through ICW who have ran successful shows in both London and Newcastle.\\n\\nI’ve been really fortunate so far with the opportunities I’ve had in wrestling and I’m so grateful to both TJ Rage and Kid Fite for their high level of training and to all the promoters who have ever put my on a show. I’m having a rare time with the wrestling and I’m lucky to be a part of some of the top promotions in the country.\\n\\nCheers to Kenny for taking the time to answer the questions, and it goes without saying, but get yerselves to all of these shows, and any other show Kenny might be on, and any other show with wrestling on it, cause wrestling is the fuckin best shit on the planet that disnae involve breasts, and sometimes it even involves breasts!',\n",

       " 'Monday, April 5, 2010\\n\\nInspiration From Behind\\n\\nToday I was driving home from work and noticed a truck in front of me, one lane over. It was actually the truck\\'s camper I noticed, truth be told, which looked like Paul Bunyan\\'s playpen if he went to a daycare that wasn\\'t up to code. The wooden slats were covered in bumper stickers of varying colors and sizes. What I have to assume was a strategic move to ensure maximum readership, the best sticker of the bunch was placed in the top right-hand corner (which we all know from Google analysis is the most effective spot).\\n\\nIt said, \"Don\\'t be a dick.\"\\n\\nYeah, I thought. I\\'m with you, buddy. Now, this was a sentiment I support. It wasn\\'t political (there was no Dick Cheney photo), it wasn\\'t a band (like Citizen Dick) and it didn\\'t have a web site promoted underneath. I took it as a proverb of sorts, probably more colorful than Jesus would like, but with the same kind of heart.\\n\\nI started to look for an image of this particular bumper sticker online so I could post it here, but after three unsuccessful tries I started to get a gnawing feeling in my stomach. This is my work laptop I\\'m writing on, and I really don\\'t want to have to explain to someone why I kept typing \"dick\" into a search engine after hours. Who\\'s with me here?\\n\\nWhat stuck with me most is there\\'s got to be a story behind this. Most people post a sticker that announces their political persuasion, their vanity about their kids\\' grades, their desire to pee on a [insert your brand here] vehicle, or what their stick figure family would look like. I don\\'t often see a sticker with a good lesson for us all on the back of a truck camper. (Although I did find it polite that one was open about the fact that he does brake for hookers; it\\'s always good to know when a large vehicle is coming to a stop. Thanks for the heads up!) So I\\'m thinking either the guy driving had such a bad experience, SUCH a dick in his life that he felt personally responsible from preventing it from happening to someone else...or he is fully aware he is a horrible driver, plans to continue driving badly, and is warning you upfront not to succumb to road rage. The more I thought about it, the less warm fuzzy I felt and the more worried I became.Are you about to litter? I wondered. What, am I not supposed to get mad if you throw your trash out the window, only to have it bounce off my windshield? Or if you keep encountering dick after dick, shouldn\\'t you do a little self-examination? Maybe it\\'s YOU, not them.\\n\\nWith a sticker like that, a cop is bound to notice. So what, are you anti-police or something? Anti-government? Are you one of those crazies who lives on a compound somewhere? Don\\'t get in my lane.\\n\\nAnd really, by telling me not to \"be\" a dick, aren\\'t you kind of saying I could be already, that you see that quality in me, even though all I\\'m doing is driving behind you, innocently, listening to my Owl City album on my iPod? That\\'s pretty rude, man. Jeez. Why don\\'t you take your own advice already and leave me the hell alone?',\n",

       " 'When 24-year-old Morris Beckman returned to his house on Amhurst Road in Hackney, he’d experienced quite a lot. His time fighting fascism abroad had seen him survive two Nazi torpedo attacks on a British Navy ship in the Atlantic. While his relieved mother showered him with affection on his return home, his father’s message was rather starker: ‘The bastards are back,’ he warned. Indeed, the London that Beckman returned to fell far short of the expectations of himself and millions of other ex-servicemen. Though it may run counter to the popular narrative of the triumph over Hitler, fascism grew rapidly in Britain immediately following the Second World War. Fascist prisoners interned during the war began to reorganise their crippled movement, while a new presence of captured Nazi soldiers being released from prisoner-of-war camps and into British society prompted a far-right renaissance. Within months of the war’s end, fourteen fascist groups and at least three bookshops operated openly across the city. Newspapers with names like Britain Awake and The Patriot were readily available on street corners. Most alarmingly of all, fascists began staging outdoor rallies in the densely-Jewish East End once again. ‘Openly in the streets you had public meetings shouting out the same antagonism and the same filth as before the war,’ commando veteran Jules Konopinski recalled, ‘and now even worse – they were saying the gas chambers weren’t enough.’ Alarm spread among the Jewish community that anti-Semitism could find a foothold so soon after the defeat of the Nazis.\\n\\nEmergence Nowhere was alarm at the situation felt more strongly than in Maccabi House, a Jewish sports club in Hampstead. Morris Beckman recalled that the club had a ‘subdued ambience’ that reflected the ‘weariness and uncertainties’ of the times. Polish-Jewish veterans of the Allied forces with no families or homes to return to were forging friendships in a new city. Several pre-war Maccabi regulars died fighting Hitler. The ones that had survived, once awash with optimism, were now world-weary veterans who mixed uncomfortably with jovial teenagers who hadn’t served. In those days the true enormity of the Holocaust wasn’t known, and as the full picture began to emerge it had a profound effect on the community. Jewish ex-servicemen in particular carried a ‘sick sense of shame’, Beckman said, that no Allied action had been taken to prevent Nazi operations in the death camps. This consciousness was emerging at the same time as walls in London — whose Jewish community had only escaped the fate of their European neighbours by geographical quirk — were once again being daubed with swastikas. To many, it felt as if Britain hadn’t learnt a thing. The Truth, a magazine whose editor, Colin Brooks, was a close confidante of Daily Mail owner Lord Rothermere, called for Jews to give up their houses to ‘British’ ex-servicemen. In October 1945, thousands signed an ‘anti-alien’ petition in Hampstead which called to expel the area’s large Jewish refugee population. In February 1946, while driving for a pint in Hampstead Heath, four young Jewish ex-servicemen — the former Hurricane ace Alec Carson, Gerry Flamberg, Len Sherman, and Morris Beckman — witnessed a rally by the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, the organisation of Jeffrey Hamm. A familiar face of pre-war fascism, Hamm was interned for his loyalty to Hitler and was now seeking to rebuild Oswald Mosley’s movement. Addressing a sixty-strong meeting, Hamm chose his words carefully, denouncing the ‘aliens in our midst’ who ‘waxed fat in the black market’ while British soldiers died. Pretending to buy a copy of Britain Awake, Sherman abruptly knocked two fascists unconscious by banging their heads together. Flamberg toppled the makeshift stage and knocked Hamm over. As the crowd scattered, an elderly German Jew stayed to shake their hands. It occurred to all four that they could face serious charges for their actions. ‘Well then,’ Carson said, ‘it’s about time they change the laws.’ Their action was widely supported, and an organising meeting at Maccabi House was arranged to push back the fascist threat. Thirty-eight ex-servicemen and five women turned up. The vast majority were Jewish, but the group also included non-Jewish socialists like Joe Zilliacus, a former Marine and son of left-wing Labour MP Konni Zilliacus. What united them was their conviction that the Jewish community must not be passive in the face of provocations. Alec Black, a veteran of the D-Day landings, proposed establishing an organisation that could effectively fight fascism and anti-Semitism. He knew this would be a serious endeavour and emphasised that everyone involved would risk serious harm and jail time. Anyone feeling nervous about this activity could leave without any judgement or prejudice against them. No one moved an inch or said a word. The organisation had two aims: to prevent fascist activities by physical force if necessary, and to pressure Parliament into making racial incitement a criminal offence. Since those present had few motivations beyond completing the tasks at hand, no grandiose names were suggested. It was decided they would be called ‘The 43 Group’, after the number of people in the room. But, by April of that year, the name seemed misplaced; over 300 people had bolstered the Group’s ranks.\\n\\nConfrontation After encountering their first post-war instances of physical resistance, London’s fascists dropped their respectable veneer. Rather than hiding behind dog-whistle phrases, the seasoned repertoire of Hitler salutes, ‘Heil Mosley’ chants, and renditions of the Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, returned. In the face of constant physical attacks in their communities and workplaces, fascist anger grew increasingly frenzied. A bomb was pushed through the door of Gerry Flamberg’s home, while two 43 Group commandos beat unconscious a young fascist who had stitched razorblades into a flat cap and charged through Stamford Hill slashing people’s faces. In November 1946, 43 Group militants published a letter in the Jewish Chronicle appealing for further assistance. It inspired a swell in members, but provoked an angry response from Louis Hydelman, who sat on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Accusing the young commandos of acting ‘counterproductively’, Hydelman ordered the Group to disband. His intervention only highlighted the divide between young Jews committed to tackling the fascist presence and the older communal leadership, who remained legalistic in outlook. Hydelman’s letter, derided for its patronising tone, fell on deaf ears. The Group’s impressive infrastructure, convinced members they could afford to ignore their critics. Not only could they boast of an active base of 1,000 members, but they had also made influential friends. Left-wing Labour MPs such as D. N. Pritt, John Platt-Mills, and Woodrow Wyatt were keen supporters, while entertainment giants Jack Solomon and Bud Flanagan regularly donated significant sums to the organisation. On the streets, confrontations intensified. Tightly-organised 43 Group units would form human ‘wedges’ at rallies, pushing through fascist security to attack the stage, and use ‘supporting parties’ to heckle and break up fascist proceedings. On Sunday, 1 June 1947, these skirmishes came to a head in Ridley Road, a market area of Hackney known for its vibrant Jewish life. The fascists’ decision to demonstrate here was particularly provocative as it had been a favoured site of Mosley’s British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The 43 Group organised for the ‘Battle for Ridley Road’ with military precision. Commandos were given maps of the surrounding streets with entry and exit points for ambush attacks. But walking up to the platform they were still taken back by the size of the far-right crowd. With police backing too, the fascists hugely outnumbered the 43 Group. But they nonetheless infiltrated the audience in front of the stage and, when fascist leader Alexander Raven Thomson began to speak, started heckling. ‘Going back to the Isle of Man for your holidays?’ one commando shouted. (Thomson had been imprisoned in a detention camp on the Isle of Man during the war.) ‘They should have hanged you with William Joyce!’ said another. Then the wedge struck and ferocious fighting broke out. A description of scenes by Morris Beckman recalls the intensity. A young fascist about eighteen years of age appeared in front of me and called me a ‘Fucking Jew bastard’, catching my left thigh with a nearly well-aimed kick. I hit his nose square on and it spurted blood … I kicked his backside as hard as I could and he staggered off. A hard blow landed smack on my right ear and completely unbalanced me. For a moment, I was dazed, disorientated. My assailant was about to close and finish me off when Sam grabbed him around the neck and pulled him to the ground. Then Sam jumped on him. The genial, good-humoured Sam said, ‘I’m just breaking the bastard’s ribs so he won’t attend any more meetings.’',\n",

What on earth are you wearing? “No profanity: that’s fine, I’ve got a huge vocabulary.” It’s really clear that they’ve toned down Ricky Gervais from last year. Though the dig at Justin Bieber was pretty good. “No, he’s not the father. The only way he could impregnate anyone is if he borrowed one of Martha Stewart’s turkey basters.”\\n\\n7:07 Even Johnny Depp admits he hasn’t seen “The Tourist.” First sneak peek at the Best Motion Picture – Drama nominees is Hugo. This will be fun trying to figure out why certain people are presenting these films. Don’t see the Johnny Depp to Hugo connection yet.\\n\\n7:08 Gerard Butler and Mila Kunis present Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. Christopher Plummer wins for “Beginners.” I can always count on the old people for adorable acceptance speeches.\\n\\n7:12 Ashton Kutcher and Elle MacPherson present Best Actress on TV in Comedy/Musical. Elle’s dress is weird-looking. She’s got weird wing things on her boobs. Amy Poehler thoroughly eyefucks the camera. Laura Dern wins for “Enlightened.” I can’t remember if it’s been canceled, but if it hasn’t, maybe someone will watch this show now…other than the Hollywood Foreign Press apparently. Had no idea Laura Dern’s mom is Diane Ladd. Nice. She gives shoutouts to Lucille Ball and Frank Capra. At least she has awesome inspirations. UPDATE: Enlightened was renewed. Maybe this will get people to watch it?\\n\\n7:19 Rob Lowe and Julianne Moore introduce Miss Golden Globe. Super awkward pause as the teleprompter freezes and someone brings Julianne Moore a script. Andie MacDowell’s daughter got recruited as this year’s Bring Your Daughter to an Awards Show person. Best Miniseries time. Golden Globe goes to Downton Abbey. Get ready for a sweep for Downton Abbey in the Miniseries categories tonight. People freaking love it. Adorable British people give adorable acceptance speech. We got distracted when our icemaker started working again.\\n\\n7:23 Rob Low and Julianne Moore come back to present Best Actress in a Miniseries. Kate Winslet wins for Mildred Pierce! This surprises absolutely no one. She didn’t have very steep competition. Sorry, Diane Lane. Kate Winslet is always so dignified and gracious. I’m pretty much in love with her. No lie. Finally starting with the play-off music.\\n\\n7:26 Frieda Pinto comes out to show a preview of Midnight in Paris. I’m thinking it’s the Oscars that tries to come up with connections to the movie. Golden Globes just gets random people to present the films.\\n\\n7:27 Okay, I want to watch what happens at the awards during the commercial break, especially as the attendees get progressively drunker. That would be a super entertaining show. Can we make this happen?\\n\\n7:32 Obligatory message from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as we pretend to actually care about who brings these awards to us every year. Granted, they do a lot of philanthropic work, but no one will remember that after this speech. Sorry, y’all.\\n\\n7:33 Jake Gyllenhaal comes out to present a preview for My Week With Marilyn. Rant time: Why on earth is this in the Comedy or Musical category? It’s extremely dramatic and there is almost no music in it! Sometimes, I understand their reasoning, but this makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!\\n\\n7:34 Ricky Gervais asks for short speeches. “You don’t have to thank members of your family who have done absolutely nothing.” Obligatory atheist dig at God. Melissa McCarthy and Paula Patton come out to present Best Actor in a TV Series – Drama. Paula is wearing a very yellow dress. I can’t decide how I feel about it. Kelsey Grammer wins for Boss. The HFPA loves to pretend like it’s super trendy and Boss is very trendy, but no one watches it.\\n\\n7:37 McCarthy and Patton stick around to present Best TV Series – Drama. Homeland wins. If Game of Thrones had ended after Homeland, it would have been GoT. The HFPA has such a short-term memory, though, and all anyone can talk about is how good Homeland is. Game of Thrones lost out by ending during the summer. The others didn’t have a shot. Massive cast gets on stage. Pretty sure it’ll take longer for all of them to get up there than they’ll be able to talk. Amy Poehler found something about Les Moonves super funny. Don’t know why this guy thanked Moonves. Does CBS own Showtime?\\n\\n7:44 Jimmy Fallon and Adam Levine come out and pull their best “moves like Jagger.” Fallon goes on to spaz and act weird. I love Jimmy Fallon, but that was just awkward. They present Best Original Score to Ludovic Bource for The Artist. Be prepared for The Artist to sweep tonight as well. Bource apologizes for being French. He talks about how music is universal. This guy is adorbs.\\n\\n7:48 Fallon and Levine stick around to present Best Original Song. Thought it would be Glenn Close, but they decided to pick Madonna instead. Oh well, this will be the only win for WE. I still don’t know why Madonna tries to have a really pretentious British accent sometimes. You’re not fooling anyone. Story about how Madonna had to be coerced into writing a song for her movie. None of us buy that. Also, that dress must be cutting off circulation to your boobs.\\n\\n7:52 Unknown Turkish film person comes out to say hey to her peeps in Turkey. Then she leaves. Well, that was weird.\\n\\n7:57 Debra Messing and Katharine McPhee come out to pimp their show and talk about how Best Actor in a Miniseries is one of the most prestigious awards ever. Weird. Idris Elba wins for Luther. Adorbs British accent. Super sexy. And he gives a shoutout to his daughter who is having a Golden Globe party. Adorable.\\n\\n7:59 Brad Pitt comes out to present Ides of March. Want to see this so badly. Ryan Gosling is beautiful. As per us.\\n\\n8:00 Seth Rogen and Kate Beckinsale come out to present Best Actress in a Movie – Comedy or Musical. Jodie Foster brought her kids. How cute. Michelle Williams wins for the “hysterical comedy” My Week With Marilyn. Thank you, Seth Rogen, for pointing this out to us. Michelle Williams thanks her daughter. She points out that Marilyn Monroe won the same award she just did. She seems so flustered and adorbs. She’s come so far since the days of Dawson’s Creek.\\n\\n8:08 Sarah Michelle Gellar and Piper Perabo come out to present Best Supporting Actor on TV. Perabo’s dress is hiding some people in it. No joke. That thing is huge. Jesse Tyler Ferguson holds up a sign that says “whatever” over Eric Stonestreet’s shoulder. Peter Dinklage wins, which shocks no one. He talks about how his mom thought Guy Pearce would win in this category instead. He could hide in Piper Perabo’s skirt easily.\\n\\n8:10 Ricky Gervais talks about how last year’s audience had “a right stick up their ass.” He introduces George Clooney and says if he gets any more popular or handsome, he’ll be hosting the show next year. Clooney stole Brad Pitt’s cane and comes out to present Moneyball.\\n\\n8:13 Channing Tatum and Jessica Alba come out to present Best Animated Feature Film. The Adventures of Tintin wins, upsetting the streak that Rango has been having in this category. We decide Steven Spielberg probably has a shed devoted to the Golden Globes.\\n\\n8:20 Ewan McGregor comes out to present a preview for 50/50. He gives a shoutout to Christopher Plummer and says “good job, Pops.”\\n\\n8:23 Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy come out to present Best Supporting Actress on TV, all in song. Adorbs. Jessica Lange wins for American Horror Story. She was definitely the best actor on that show. Sorry, Jessica Lange, but your dress is super fug. Jessica Lange thanks the people who worked on her show. Producers do a close-up on Meryl Streep, for some inexplicable reason. Lange goes on to call many writers in Hollywood talentless hacks, but she does it in a super classy way.\\n\\n8:28 So, there’s this one commercial for McDonald’s that can’t decide which dimension it wants to be in and it just switches rapidly between dimensions. I feel it needs a warning for people who are epileptic.\\n\\n8:30 Ricky Gervais has moved on to wine. He introduces Madonna by saying she’s “just like a virgin.” Madonna then says Ricky should come over and do something about that. Ricky then runs across the back of the stage. Funniest moment of the night so far. Madonna says she grew up watching foreign films and there’s nothing foreign about them to her. I call bullshit on her pretentiousness. Angelina Jolie loses to Iran for “A Separation.” Also, Christian Bale is in the film from China. Iranian guy gives a very touching acceptance speech while another guy stands next to him with his arms crossed and looks super pissed off.\\n\\n8:34 Aw, Dustin Hoffman! He gives a thank you speech before going on to announce nominations for Best Actress on TV – Drama. Claire Danes wins for Homeland, which shocks absolutely no one. She comes out from the back way for some weird reason. She winks and points at her table. She thanks her parents because she forgot to thank them when she won back in 1995 for My So-Called Life. Her mom is apparently her date. Adorbs. She thanks her gorgeous husband, Hugh Dancy. And here comes the playoff music.\\n\\n8:38 Accountants come out to strike a pose with the envelope for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical – TV. Close-up on the female accountant’s boobs. The envelope is front of them, but it’s still awkward.\\n\\n8:42 Emily Blunt comes out to present the preview for Bridesmaids, the funniest movie of the past year. Apparently, all anyone can talk about is that “women can finally poop their pants.”\\n\\n8:43 Tina Fey and Jane Lynch come out to present Best Actor on TV in a Comedy/Musical. They have the best banter ever. Matt LeBlanc wins for Episodes. Apparently, the HFPA decides that since Alec Baldwin refuses to show up anymore, they’ll give it to someone else. If only it could have been Johnny Galecki. Alas. Matt LeBlanc is pretty freaking awesome, though.\\n\\n8:46 Bradley Cooper comes out to present Best Supporting Actress in a Movie. Octavia Spencer wins for The Help. So well-deserved. I may have hated that movie, but she was truly fantastic. Maya Rudolph gives her a standing ovation. Everyone wants to kiss her on the way up. They play the super inspirational song from The Help. Everyone in that room loves her. Seriously. Melissa McCarthy is in tears. Octavia is crying as she quotes MLK. I love when people are legitimately blown away by their wins. She is so flustered and is just absolutely endearing. Fun fact: The Help is at Table 10 tonight.\\n\\n8:52 Apparently, the Golden Globes are tweeting the winners before they’re announced on TV. Nice one, y’all.\\n\\n8:55 Sidney Poitier comes out to present the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Morgan Freeman. Everyone gives him a standing ovation. He begins talking about how kickass Morgan Freeman is and how he becomes every character he plays. Shoutouts to Spencer Tracy, Laurence Olivier, and others. Morgan Freeman looks like he’s about to cry. Poitier says Freeman is a prince in the profession he has chosen. Helen Mirren comes out and says she’s had a couple glasses of wine, but she has a bone to pick with Morgan Freeman because she’s only been in one film with him. It goes on a bit long, but it’s Helen Mirren so we’re okay with it. And here comes the retrospective of films. Damn, this man has been in some amazing movies over time.\\n\\n9:00 Best part of that retrospective: the clip from Electric Company where he’s bathing in a casket. And according to IMDB, his first role was as an uncredited man on the street in The Pawnbroker in 1964.\\n\\n9:03 Morgan Freeman comes up and says he absolutely loves Helen Mirren. He said that after working with her on Red and watching her handle a gun, he knows he never wants to piss her off. He also says he will call his award the Sidney Poitier Award. He talks about how he got to make movies with people he admires and that he’s had so much fun. Then he randomly says hey to Elton John. Oh, Morgan Freeman. You’re so fantastic.\\n\\n9:07 Fun fact: Morgan Freeman’s first credited role was in a 1971 film called “Who Says You Can’t Ride a Rainbow.” He played a character named Afro.\\n\\n9:10 Robert Downey, Jr. comes out in a tux with tails. He introduces the preview of The Artist.\\n\\n9:12 Angelina Jolie comes out to introduce Best Director. Martin Scorsese wins for Hugo. Definitely thought it was going to be Michel Hazanavicius. Scorsese gives a shoutout to the HFPA for their work in film preservation. He gives a shoutout to his wife who gave him the book Hugo is based on and encouraged him to make a film his 12-year-old daughter could actually see. Ben Kingsley waves from the back. Scorsese leaves out Chloe Grace Moretz, which makes me sad.\\n\\n9:15 Ricky Gervais is back with another glass of wine. He introduces Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas. They bleep Ricky Gervais and then Antonio Banderas starts yelling in Spanish. If he’s saying something bad, the censors don’t know it. They go on to give Best TV Comedy to Modern Family. The kids all run up from the back. Sofia Vergara starts yelling in Spanish. She’s either really silly or she is absolutely smashed right now. Best acceptance speech ever. Sofia Vergara gives the actual acceptance speech in Spanish and Steven Levitan (I think) translates it, but turns it into a speech about how the writers are the best lovers Sofia has had and all film actresses need to give them their numbers. Freaking awesome.\\n\\n9:23 Michelle Pfeiffer comes out. Her face does not look real anymore. She goes on to show the preview for War Horse.\\n\\n9:24 What is Jessica Biel wearing and why does she have three boobs all of a sudden? Her and Mark Wahlberg present Best Actor in a Movie – Comedy/Musical to Jean Dujardin for The Artist. Dujardin mentions that he is French, too. Nice callback to Ludovic Bource’s speech earlier. Dujardin tells how he was told that he would never do movies because his face is too expressive. Apparently, his eyebrows think independently. That man is freaking adorable.\\n\\n9:31 Queen Latifah (from “Joyful Noise,” which she has to pretend is a good movie right now) comes out to introduce The Help.\\n\\n9:33 Ricky Gervais has ditched his ugly jacket. He introduces Colin Firth and acts super jealous of him. According to Gervais, Colin Firth is super racist and has punched a blind kitten. Firth makes a dig back at Gervais and goes on to introduce the nominees for Best Actress – Drama. Meryl Streep wins for The Iron Lady. Everyone gives her a standing ovation. She acts like she’s surprised to win and says she only got to play Margaret Thatcher after Ricky Gervais’s deal fell through. They bleep Meryl Streep. Pretty sure that’s not allowed. Someone is passing her glasses up from the back. And Meryl is just naming off random actresses now. Meryl just called Harvey Weinstein God. She’ll probably get some crap for that tomorrow. They start to play her off, but she says no and they stop for a second. That’s how famous Meryl Streep is, y’all.\\n\\n9:39 Jane Fonda comes out to present Best Movie – Comedy/Musical. In a move that surprises absolutely no one, The Artist wins. Even the dog is there! People get distracted from the producer’s speech by the dog’s adorableness. Also, Jean Dujardin’s wife is totally recording the entire ceremony on her cameraphone. So adorbs. The dog is totally begging for a treat. So cute. Another producer tries to say something, but they are actually pulling the mic back into the stage. Damn.\\n\\n9:47 Ricky Gervais introduces Natalie Portman and talks about putting her family first this year led her to not be nominated for anything. She presents Best Actor in a Drama to George Clooney for The Descendants. Where the fuck is Ryan Gosling? Why isn’t he there? I want to see his beautiful, feminist-loving face and body in a tux tonight. George Clooney is his standard, adorable self.\\n\\n9:54 Harrison Ford comes out to present Best Picture – Drama. They barely even show his face before they start showing the nominees. The Descendants wins. One of the producers comes up and says they’ve been told to hurry, so they rush through the acceptance speech as much as possible. Alexander Payne starts talking. Play-off music starts up.\\n\\n9:57 Ricky Gervais comes back to close out the show. Perfect summary of the evening, “I hope you’ve enjoyed your goodie bags, the champagne, the gold. I hope it took your mind off the recession.” They end with a close-up of the crystal chandelier. Nice.\\n\\n9:59 Final score. 15 for 25.

       " 'Experts quickly connected the alleged shooter, a truck driver named Robert Bowers, with Gab’s anti-Semitism by reviewing his posts, which were publicly available but have since been removed from the site, which itself was shuttered for several days after the attack but is once again available. When the Southern Poverty Law Center analyzed Bowers’s posts, it identified central themes that included “white genocide” and “globalism” — a buzzword often referring to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. Similar analyses of his posts presented equivalent conclusions.\\n\\nWe have a unique set of data that includes not just all of Bowers’s Gab posts but also all Gab posts since the site launched in 2016. The daily use of Gab is climbing. When the Pittsburgh shooting occurred, we recognized that our data could tell us more about both the accused shooter and his network — and possibly offer clues about who might escalate from online hate to violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat did the alleged Pittsburgh shooter talk about on Gab, and with whom?\\n\\nWe used a custom API to scrape every post, reply and quote from every user on Gab, reaching back to the site’s launch in 2016. Our database includes all Gab posts, even those users subsequently deleted from the site. We used text-analysis methods in Python to analyze the massive volume of data.\\n\\nSince joining Gab in January 2018, Bowers contributed 998 posts and replies to others’ posts. With text analytics of his nearly 1,000 posts, replies and quotes, we found overwhelmingly anti-Semitic ideations.\\n\\nBower’s two most commonly used words were “kike” and “jew,” often associated with terms like “vile” and “degenerate,” and many other anti-Semitic references as well. For example, he frequently used the hashtag “#everysingletime,” referring to an alt-right Jewish conspiracy theory in which Jews are behind orchestrated efforts to attack white culture and values.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab has “groups” in which members with similar interests hold conversations. Many of Bowers’s posts were in these groups, especially the “Guns of Gab,” “Supremacy,” “Immigration” and “Anti-white” groups, which reinforced his interest in firearms and white-supremacist philosophy.\\n\\nBowers boasted about 600 friends and followers on Gab but was far less active than many in his network. Judging by the number of messages sent among members, Bowers was tightly connected with a select few members of this network and loosely connected with many.\\n\\nComparing Bowers to the typical Gab user\\n\\nWe compared Bowers’s activity and his social network to the larger Gab community. Our analysis suggests that while Bowers does not perfectly represent the rest of Gab’s members, substantial similarities exist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe gathered the 200 most commonly used hashtags on Gab to compare to Bowers’s. The hashtags included #altright and #whitegenocide, themes in Bowers’s posts. Bowers’s posts and the most popular Gab hashtags both included references to political conspiracy theories such as #qanon and #releasethememo.\\n\\nBut Bowers’s posts and replies differ in his nearly exclusive focus on anti-Semitic ideas. In the rare times he touched on other topics, those were general alt-right political discussions about white supremacy and related themes. The average Gab user was much more focused on general current political topics, with hashtags including #maga, #trump, #fakenews and #politics.\\n\\nThe larger network active on Gab\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab conversations are heavily laden with alt-right themes. As you can see in the illustration above, since 2016, one of the hashtags most commonly used on Gab has been #altright.\\n\\nOther common Gab hashtags from the same data set suggest broader anti-immigration themes, including #buildthewall, #bansharia and #banislam. These hashtags were among the most common in a set of more than 30 million posts — indicating that these sentiments are pervasive. As you can see, Gab also overflows with political conspiracy theory discussions, with such common hashtags as #pizzagate, #draintheswamp and #deepstate. Gun rights activism shows up in hashtags such as #2a and #nra.\\n\\nUsers have posted roughly 30 million comments on Gab since its 2016 launch. Below you can see that the volume of Gab activity by posts, replies and quotes has grown over time.\\n\\nWhite supremacy and anti-Semitism have endured in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League documented a 57 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents from 2016 to 2017. FBI hate crime statistics for 2016 show that more than half of faith-based crimes were against Jews.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, many expected the alt-right to retreat from physical gatherings and return to digital realms. Instead, alt-right gangs such as the Proud Boys, the Atomwaffen Division and their followers, have become bolder, engaging in street violence at rallies, bomb plots and killings.\\n\\nOur analyses show that Bowers is not alone in his hatred. Gab has roughly 450,000 users, and while many do not espouse anti-Semitism, a sizable number do and regularly connect online to share their ideology. Our analyses also show that these individuals are not difficult to find or monitor.\\n\\nThe challenge comes in knowing when they will escalate from online speech to real-world action.\\n\\nMatthew Phillips (@mdphill1_uncc) is an assistant professor of criminal justice and criminology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nArunkumar Bagavathi is a final-year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

       " 'Have you heard that the Republican tax reform proposal is a sweetheart deal for \"the rich,\" and doesn\\'t help middle class Americans? Yes, you have. Liberals keep repeating it, and we keep debunking it -- over and over again. These claims largely stem from some combination of (a) ignorance of the facts, (b) a misleading focus on raw dollars versus percentages (of course wealthy taxpayers will receive more relief in terms of sheer dollars, as they shoulder -- by far -- the highest proportional and actual tax burden of any income cohort, and (c) cherry-picked data points from a distant, hypothetical and unlikely future in which Congress chooses to allow a giant tax hike on the middle class. In reality, the overwhelming majority of all middle class households will receive a tax cut under the GOP plan, and the rich don\\'t receive a disproportional benefit. Indeed, at the request of President Trump, House Republicans wrote their bill to exclude an income rate cut for the \"millionaires and billionaires\" Democrats so love to invoke. But that didn\\'t stop the Washington Post from once again claiming in a front page story that the Republican-crafted legislation had veered away from middle income earners in favor of the rich. The CATO Institute\\'s Chris Edwards swooped in with a detailed fact check, starting with a description of WaPo\\'s false premise:\\n\\nNews stories are portraying the Republican tax bills as favoring the rich, even though the opposite is true. The GOP cuts would make the tax code more progressive, and the largest percentage cuts would go to middle-income households. The Washington Post pushed another faulty narrative yesterday. The three layers of headlines on the hardcopy front page were, “Trump’s tax vow taking a U-turn—focus shifted away from middle class—GOP plan evolved into a windfall for the wealthy.” The story’s theme was that Trump originally promised middle-class tax cuts, but House and Senate tax bills have morphed into an orgy of tax cuts for corporations and rich people. Ridiculous.\\n\\nWhy \"ridiculous\"? Well, because the facts say so:\\n\\nRather than a “windfall for the wealthy” as the Post claims, the GOP bills would provide larger percentage cuts for middle earners than higher earners (see here and here). The GOP may abandon cutting the top individual tax rate at all. Much of the cuts for high earners are allocated corporate tax cuts, but economists disagree about who those cuts would actually benefit. Furthermore, the GOP tax bills would increase spending subsidies (refundable credits) for people at the bottom who do not pay any individual income taxes. Look at this TPC analysis of the Senate bill. It shows the bottom two quintiles receiving tax “cuts” in 2019 and 2025, yet those groups do not currently pay any income taxes on net...The following chart shows the TPC data in context. First, note the enormous share of federal taxes paid by the top quintile under current law. The chart includes all federal taxes—income, payroll, estate, and excise for 2019. Now observe that the top quintile would receive a smaller share of the Senate tax cut than their tax share under current law. For the three middle quintiles, it is the opposite. That means that the Senate tax cut would make the federal tax code more progressive. If the Senate tax cut is enacted, higher earners would pay a larger share of the overall federal tax burden.\\n\\nEdwards\\' analysis laments the fact that the GOP plan is too progressive and therefore insufficiently pro-growth, but despite those frustrations, he cannot abide supposedly objective journalists furnishing readers with the opposite of the truth. Here is the chart he mentions:\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that the top 20 percent pay close to 70 percent of all federal taxes (blue bars), but would receive just over 60 percent of the tax cut (red bars) under the Senate bill. For the bottom quintile -- who barely pay any federal taxes to begin with -- their share of the cuts would be (slightly) disproportionately small (which is not the same as a tax increase, mind you). As for the middle income earners in quintiles two, three and four? They all get disproportionately large tax cuts, on average, compared to their share of federal taxes paid. As Edwards writes, this is precisely the opposite of what the Washington Post told its readers. The data above, incidentally, comes from the left-leaning Tax Policy Center; other nonpartisan groups have offered even rosier projections about the GOP\\'s plans, across an array of metrics. When a Twitter skirmish broke out over WaPo\\'s conclusions yesterday, the Manhattan Institute\\'s Brian Riedl (whose work I cited in this post) further underscored Edwards\\' correct argument:\\n\\nDerek -- Per TPC\\n\\n\\n\\n--Bottom 80% of families currently pay 33% of all combined federal taxes, yet would get 37% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\n--Top 1% currently pays 27% of all federal taxes but would get just 18% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo tax code becomes MORE progressive. — Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) December 11, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMight the Post\\'s in-house fact-checker care to assign some Pinocchios to their own paper\\'s misleading headline and reporting? As for the Bernie-championed line that by 2027 the Senate bill would hand 62 percent of that year\\'s tax cuts to the top one percent of wage earners, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be shocked to learn that\\'s also a garbage stat.

I know\\nthis happens.\\nBut the worst thing is ten years later you\\nsee their photo on Facebook with their spouse\\nAnd your immediate reaction is, “This mediocrity\\nis worse than my mediocrity”\\nA part of you dies inside right? You feel,\\n“I should have tried”\\nAnd I don’t think it is just as individuals.\\nIndia as a country sends people to olympics\\nto get us silver and bronze.\\nAs a nation we are like, “Hey we don’t\\nneed Gold from you!”\\n“We have dowry for that”\\nThis is not even a joke, that’s why Marykom\\nwins a lot of Gold.\\nBecause every time she walks into a ring,\\nshe doesn’t see an opponent.\\nShe see her in laws and she goes, “I need\\nGold today!”\\nAnd then starts punching them crazily.\\nTo be honest, the only one non-mediocre thing\\nI have done in my life is that…\\nI scored an All India Rank of 232 in IIT-JEE.\\nYeah right, give it up for Narayana coaching\\ninstitute I guess.\\nMy parents were super proud. They were like,\\n“Navin, you are the best son NOW!”\\nAnd then I woke up from the dream.\\nYou guys really thought I am an IITian?\\nDon’t I look happy for you guys?\\nThe worst thing is that the dream was real.\\nI had it in high school.\\nAnd what annoys me till date is that even\\nin the dream,\\nI didn’t expect to get an All India Rank\\nof 1, 2, 3…\\nNot even in the top 100.\\n232 was the magic number of my mediocrity.\\nAnd the worst thing is you guys clapped for\\nthat number also.\\nThe worst thing is that sometimes you are\\nhappy with your mediocrity.\\nBut the universe keeps reminding you of your\\naukath.\\nI don’t about you guys, happens to me all\\nthe time.\\nLike recently I wanted to get an iPhone.\\nAnd then I realised I don’t have the budget\\nfor it.\\nSo my friend told me, “Dude don’t worry,\\nget a one plus phone…\\nThat is the next best thing. That is the distant\\ncousin of iPhone”\\nAnd I was like, “Okay cool”\\nI got a One plus phone. I unboxed it. I switched\\nit on.\\nAnd the wall paper said in block letters,”NEVER\\nSETTLE”\\nI was like, “Too late for this advice dude.\\nI got you because I settled…\\nWhat is this reverse marketing that your are\\ntrying to do here?\\nShould I sell you right now?\\nAnd firstly ‘NEVER SETTLE’ is such an\\nanti national tagline for a country like India.\\nI am like, “If my parents find out that\\nyour are asking me not to settle, they will get me an iPhone…\\nAnd a wife also probably.\\nAnd then I will be called ’One plus one’\\nMediocrity is the only reason why I always\\nshare my cabs.\\nCos whenever I share my cabs, I am happier.\\nI will look at the other person. I will be\\nlike, “This person got the car, this person\\ngot the driver…\\nI just got a lift” And I can move on with\\nmy life.\\nBut whenever I take a cab for myself, I will\\nstart having existential questions.\\nMy brain will start shitting on me saying,\\n“Hey Navin…\\nHave you ever done anything worthy enough\\nyour whole life to possess an entire automobile\\nand a human being for yourself for the next\\none hour?\\nAnd then I have to change the drop location\\nto my therapist.\\nAfter the ride the driver is like, “Sir\\nplease give me five star rating”\\nI am like, “Sir, you please give me some\\nforgiveness. I don’t deserve you at all”\\nAnother important reason why I always share\\nmy cabs is at least whenever I used to take\\nOla share\\nOla used to send a message that says, “Hey\\nNavin, say ‘Ola’ to your co passenger.\\nFollowed by the name of the co passenger.\\nNormally if it is a guy, I wouldn’t care.\\nEven if it is a girl with normal names like\\nNeha, Hema,\\nKomalavalli.\\nDon’t laugh man, that’s a legit name.\\nMy sister has it.\\nThe problem is the last time I took Ola share,\\nmy co passenger’s name was Sureshna Ghosh.\\nAnd honestly, guys have this super power.\\nJust by seeing the name of a girl, we can\\nsay whether she is easily identifiable over\\nthe internet or not.\\nSo when I saw Sureshna Ghosh’s name, I did\\nthe manliest thing possible.\\nI stalked her on Facebook.\\nAnd the cab stopped at a place where she was\\nsupposed to get picked.\\nAnd I saw her approaching from the left.\\nAnd I wanted to be a gentleman, so I moved\\nfrom the left corner of the backseat to the\\nright corner of the backseat.\\nBut that is when this driver turned back,\\ngave me a sarcastic smile, and then he opened\\nthe front door.\\nSee not I don’t want to lose this game to\\na cab driver\\njust because he earns more than me, right?\\nSo I immediately start a conversation with\\nSureshna Ghosh\\nI called her and said. “Hey Sureshna Ghosh,\\nhow are you?…\\nHow are your parents in Kolkatta?\\nHow is your work at Dell?\\nHow are your trip last week to Munnar?\\nAnd again, guys do a lot of stupid stuff,\\nbut sometimes it takes us less than a second\\nto realise that we are being stupid and unreasonable.\\nAnd that was my moment. I realised that I\\nwas being stupid and creepy.\\nI was even ready to get a tight slap from\\nSureshna Ghosh.\\nBut that is when she did something worse.\\nShe spoke back.\\nShe was like, “I am good Navin. How are\\nyou?…\\nHow are your parents in Chennai?\\nHey btw, do you have Kenny Sebastian’s phone\\nnumber?\\n',\n",

Rice allegedly answered the request with a \"Fuck off.\" Thompson is said to have responded by taking a swing at Rice, but he didn\\'t connect.\\n\\nRice told investigators he didn\\'t retaliate at that time, but he expressed umbrage at Thompson supposedly \"asking kids for money or drugs,\" the Sentinel reports.\\n\\nThen, on August 14, Rice was with his roommate when he saw Thompson outside a Chase bank not far from the intersection of East Quincy Avenue and South Buckley Road.

But Rice reportedly said that after the initial blow, he hit Thompson again as he lay prone and said, \"Stay away from here and stay out of the neighborhood.\"\\n\\nThompson did, but not by choice. He lingered on life support for about six weeks before dying in late September. By November, Rice, who was arrested on August 20 after shaving his head and goatee in an apparent effort to alter his appearance, had been accused of manslaughter.\\n\\nNow, Rice has been convicted of that charge and first-degree assault.

       " 'Apparently something went wrong. That can happen sometimes. The problem is that this always happens when I start a task that uses the GPU, for example start a 3d-game or play a video. Therefore I don\\'t think it is necessary for folding@home to stop working on the workunit and send back the unfinished work. I think it would work fine if, when something like this happens, folding@home would go back to the last saved state of the workunit and try again before giving it up. As long as I don\\'t start other applications that use the GPU, folding@home works fine, always. Also it always goes wrong when those applications are starting up, not while they are already running. That means there is nothing wrong with the work units. They can actually be finished. Gromacs can cantinue further. I think valuable work is being wasted by returning these work units unfinished, while they could have been finished if the client didn\\'t give it up so quickly.\\n\\nRight, your gpu is not able to do both high level calculations AND display 3d crap. The gpu calculates wrong so it stops itself from continuing. Its a fail safe. Remember this is not just random numbers, its a serious high profile research program. 1 wrong number could be a disastor.. I\\'d rather the unit fail on the side of caution, cause 500pts loss to you isn\\'t worth the risk to someones life.\\n\\nThis is why its recommended to pause f@h when gaming. Pause the work, then restart when youre finished playing....\\n\\nClearly you have no idea what I\\'m talking about. My gpu CAN run folding@home and display what you call 3d crap at the same time.

You can\\'t expect me to know exactly how this high profile research program works.\\n\\nEasy. Looks like sometimes the GPU client can\\'t back off properly on your machine when something else needs the graphics card. I\\'m not sure how to fix this, but make sure your client and GPU drivers are up to date and everything should be fine. Pausing the client is a good idea. Sorry that things aren\\'t working for you.\\n\\nThere\\'s not enough information for someone to identify and fix this problem.\\n\\nFirst, you didn\\'t specify which WU or which FahCore was running or what game creates a potential conflict. Even if you provide that information, I really doubt that anyone can fix the problem. Collect all that data and hand it to a programmer and Murphy\\'s law of program support says that he\\'s going to try it less than 249 times and it will work every time he tries. He won\\'t find anything that he can fix. Moreover, it\\'s not clear to me whether this is something that might be fixed in the FahCore or if it\\'s something that might be fixed in the driver or if it\\'s something that might be fixed in the game. That means that three different programmers at three different companies will need to capture a snapshot of the problem as it occurs.\\n\\nI understand your concern, but I don\\'t know what can be done about it, other than pausing FAH as patonb suggested.\\n\\nWhat happens if you (A) Pause FAH, (B) Start the game, (C) Unpause FAH, and (D) run both your game and FAH simultaneously? (Do it at least 250 times, too.)\\n\\nv6 and earlier clients were always a little too quick to upload partial WUs after an error. That\\'s just the way it was programmed a long time ago, and that carried over to the GPU3 client when it was released.\\n\\nAlso note that v6 client development has been ended in favor of V7 software development. This behavior won\\'t be fixed in v6, but I\\'m hoping V7 does better.\\n\\nbruce wrote:There\\'s not enough information for someone to identify and fix this problem.\\n\\nFirst, you didn\\'t specify which WU or which FahCore was running or what game creates a potential conflict.

The problem with that request I think is the effectiveness of that solution, if all eue\\'s would run the last frame again, that\\'s also duplicate work, and since the system to check eue\\'s is now in place with reassigning the work unit to another donor replacing it with another one would need to be backed up by strong evidence of increased efficiency.\\n\\nIf you eue\\'d at a high percentage, there is something to be said for retrying the last frame, saving the time to get to that percentage on another donor\\'s system. But, time has shown that one particular system can eue at a fixed percentage when another will complete the unit without problems, reassigning the work unit to another donor stays a necessity therefore.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to dismiss the suggestion though, if there were abundant resources to spend on improving the clients and server code I would think it\\'s not a bad idea to retry a frame in certain conditions ( not the first frame for instance ) before returning it to Stanford with an eue report. Since the resources are limited, focus should be applied on things with the highest efficiency increases, I\\'m not sure where this would rank since it\\'s not a win win situation. In some/most cases, the frame would eue even when being repeated, waisting time before the wu is assigned to another donor, slowing the whole chain of generations.\\n\\nIf there is something with my computer that prevents a certain work unit from finishing no matter what, then the retry would still cost only a few minutes of extra work, compared to hours of extra work if it is sent to 2 other computers. I now understand what the downsides of this could be.\\n\\nI think it\\'s after all more efficient for me to not pause the client. If I paused the client every time that would easily make a difference of 4 less work units finished per day. That one work unit per week (or something like that) that crashes doesn\\'t make up for that.\\n\\nMany studies of the reliability of CPUs have been done and results published. One study of the reliability of GPUs was completed by Stanford and the paper was published. These are very important considerations needed to back up the computational methods used by FAH.\\n\\nStable computers will produce the same result if you give it the same set of calculations to be repeated. What you\\'re asking for is for science to accept results from unstable computers. No reputable scientist will trust results from unstable computers and as a consequence, Stanford does not condone/support overclocking. They can\\'t prevent you from doing it but they can insist that your hardware be inherently reliable.\\n\\nThey have no control over why your system fails, whether the failure was caused by bad hardware, by bad drivers, by overclocking, by a fault in some other program or by some unknown factor. They do have control over the results that are acceptable to their studies. The answer is pretty simple: bad results will be discarded.\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t overclock... Its the gpu\\'s inability to perfectly switch from one graphics task to another. So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nYou are wanting more efficiency, but what if youre idea happens. A gpu fails and restarts, but this btime the error isn\\'t caught. 2 months from now, the error is noticed. By then that minor glitch has propegated through the subsequent runs making all that work invalid and 2 wasted months of work. Where if the units dropped and resent to someone else, the project is not injepordy and an average of 2-3hrs is missed.\\n\\nIf youre all for science, this minor slow down is well worth the effect.\\n\\npatonb wrote:The problem isn\\'t overclock... Its the gpu\\'s inability to perfectly switch from one graphics task to another. So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nEven if we assume, as you have probably done, that the problem in inherent in the GPU\\'s hardware, it\\'s up to the drivers to resolve conflicts so I\\'d guess that someday a future version of the drivers will someday resolve this sort of issue. The fundamental problem is lack of repeatability, though, because those who write drivers are unlikely to ever see this failure in their testing. In any case, be sure to report the problem on the GPU\\'s home website.\\n\\nAre you still running the Nvidia 8800 GTS that\\'s listed in your profile? There\\'s a lot of recent discussion about NV drivers (12 pages and counting) questioning which version works correctly with specific hardware, but there are also some ATI driver issues mentioned here on our website.\\n\\nIt probably wouldn\\'t hurt to report it on the Game\\'s technical support site, too, though that\\'s less likely to matter unless your report is followed by a number of \"+1\" reports.',\n",

       " 'Who would have thought disrobing and standing in front of people in your underwear would be an omen?\\n\\nAs I drove away from my FORMER job, I was relieved, even if I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring. I knew from my family that opportunity is forever present, but it’s up to us to discern that opportunity. The first month was challenging, and I started to doubt if my speaking out was the right thing. It had to be, staying silent for me was ugly and evil. I knew I could survive, but I cringed at the thought of the battle scars. I also knew I had a few more cards to play, and I had nothing to lose.\\n\\nAfter a month, I put in my appeal of the termination. In their haste, my supervisors committed a no-no much grander in scale than the technicality that got me fired. I also started writing about all the illegal activity I could remember. A month into my battle plan, my money ran out.\\n\\nBelieve what you will, but I believe prayer works.\\n\\nThe next day, I got a phone call from another officer who had also experienced issues at the job. She informed me that the Prosecutor’s Office was doing a big investigation. By no means did enough heads roll, but they arrested a token few whose indiscretions were too much to conceal. Somebody was finally looking.\\n\\nExample: An inmate complained that she was being forced to have oral sex with an officer known to “hate inmates”. He denied it, then the inmate produced a Ziploc Baggie filled with his semen, not an easy find in an all female facility.\\n\\nWhile on the phone, the mailman came with one envelope from the Department of Justice, one from my attorney. The State of NJ wanted to settle my previous lawsuit (discrimination and harassment) and combine my suit into a Consent Decree. I’ll go into more detail in the “More Lemons Please!” book. I received a check, and I was able to exhale. However, I knew it would not last, and I had to find something.\\n\\nAfter wearing polyester for so long, I needed to find a new fashion attitude. I went to a plus sized fashion convention, where I drew some attention. As I was looking at clothes, I was asked to try on different styles by one of the vendors. I ended up modeling at the convention including a line that is known as “fetish wear”. Actually, with the fetish wear, I got A LOT of attention. I found that I became adventurous going forward, and wow did I do it with a twist!\\n\\nLater on, I also helped run that clothing company and found it strikingly easy. There was a system in place and all I had to do was follow the system. I learned that there were skills I got from law enforcement that I could re-translate. Once I knew what those skills were and saw the pattern, I was no longer one-dimensional. I stopped being stressed when I realized a change in definitions revealed more about what I could do. I packed up, walked away from my house in NJ and moved to the Midwest. I was part of a successful business.',\n",
       " 'The Sexual Manifesto: The Condom Moment\\n\\nShare this:\\n\\nYou’d be surprised how many young adults don’t just engage in safer sex but have safer sex ingrained in their practices. For some, the condom moment in a relationship is the first time ever a couple experiences flesh on flesh in the most private of areas. Go off condoms? Whaa? You mean I can stick my dick in there and come out alive?\\n\\nBut there comes a time in most serious relationships when you face an ethical and moral dilemma: to condom or not to condom. This usually happens when there’s a penis involved (most of my gals-who-like-gals pals admit to forgoing dental dams and other barriers).\\n\\nA few years ago, one of my colleagues suggested I write a column about deciding to drop condoms. As a columnist who strove to entertain and to promote safer sex, I politely declined. Besides, I always used condoms, silly! That was before my relationship got serious. Like pee-in-the-same-room serious.\\n\\nCouples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms for a partner’s health/safetyBut now I know. Deciding to drop condoms marks a moment of trust in your partner…you trust that he won’t give you HIV, HPV, or the clap. You both have accurate and current test results, and you’re not lying about them either. If you’re a straight couple, the male half has to trust that she’s always going to be reliable us using her pill/ring/patch, because, for some, babies can be even worse than STIs.\\n\\nThere are gradients of safer sex, and sometimes condoms don’t factor into the safer sex you’re having. And that’s okay as long as you’ve got your bases covered.\\n\\n1. Some form and extent of exclusivity\\n2. STI testing, with presumably acceptable results\\n3. Certain length of time together, which varies\\n4. Reliable contraception for hetero couplings\\n\\nIt’s hard for these younger types (i.e. people like me) to accept that condomless sex is not morally wrong. I already feel like I’m treading in deplorable sex column behavior here. I’m endangering the public good!\\n\\nBut, as I previously mentioned, it all boils down to trust. A trust in healthy sex.\\n\\nWith condoms as effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies and transmission of certain STIs as they are, it’s a privilege for couples to step back to au naturel. You’ve got to plan and perhaps pay extra for birth control. It takes an incredible amount of responsibility to carefully cross the condomless border because–let’s face it–not everyone can do it or do it right. Most importantly, couples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms because of a contraceptive misstep or simply for a partner’s sanity/health/safety.\\n\\nSo, sure, use a condom every time. But if this time is your 60th time with your longterm partner and neither of you is boning anyone else etc. etc., maybe you don’t have to drop a buck every time you f–ahem, engage in coitus.',\n",

When Godinez cried out that he was Mexican, the jeering reportedly turned to racial slurs like “spic” and “wetback.” According to his testimony, “The best way I can describe it is the sound of people chanting in a soccer stadium,” adding that Keenan was “laughing, smiling, and having a good time, while I could have died that day.”\\n\\nThe judge ruled that both men would be held for trial on felony charges of aggravated assault and conspiracy, along with several misdemeanors. This will be far from Keenan’s first time in legal jeopardy. As part of the “Love Park 4,” Keenan was charged with criminal conspiracy, institutional vandalism, resisting arrest, and criminal mischief.\\n\\nAt the time, Keenan only pleaded guilty to “disorderly conduct,” and the remaining charges were withdrawn.

Vomiting typically does not accompany the nausea, but in rare cases patients were Blowing Some Chunks.\\nThe second sign is Getting Some Migraine.

His eyes seem as black as his hair in that moment. They pop against the smooth porcelain of his skin, cold under my unwilling fingers.\\n\\nHis thin lips twist into an ironic smile.\\n\\n“You thought we were done,” he says in a low, throaty voice.\\n\\nI don’t deny it.\\n\\n“You told all your friends how happy you were to be through with me.”\\n\\nCan’t deny that either.\\n\\nHe grabs me by the shoulders and pulls me in, putting both hands on my face and tilting it towards his.

Looking into them is like looking into a cave or an abyss–you don’t know where they end.\\n\\nI could probably wriggle out of his grip if I tried hard enough. He’s not even holding me that tightly.

He tugs on it, not enough to hurt, but enough to keep me still. We stare each other down–him with his calmly brutal black eyes, me with my terrified, wet hazel ones.\\n\\nThen suddenly he pulls me into an embrace that feels almost real, if not for its coldness.

       " 'a journey through the stuff I do… hey, I rhymed!\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\nA nasty little surprise…\\n\\nI’m sorry to the two of you (and I’m being very generous with myself assuming there are even two of you) that read this, I quite simply haven’t had all that much to share lately. Until now, that is…\\n\\nSo, last week I found a number of transactions on my online bank statement that weren’t mine, close to $1000 worth. As you would assume, I panicked and called the bank and they put a block on my card, but as you would know if you’ve ever been the victim of credit card fraud, there isn’t a whole lot the bank can do until these transactions are actually visible on your statement. So, so begins the fun task of seeing just where this douche is spending my money. Lets say, I was not amused.\\n\\nThis arsehole dropped nearly $300 on fucking Minecraft! $500 on some sort of theme park package, and the last couple of hundred went on a Chinese joke shop and porn! If I didn’t know any better, I’d say this little twerp is fifteen years old! Which brings me around to my observation; I’m more pissed off about where my money is going rather than the fact that it was stolen in the first place! Is that weird? I’m borderline offended with what this kid is doing with my money! God, if you’re going to rob me at least make it interesting! Buy and international plane ticket and hop the country or something!\\n\\nEither way, the bank seemed confident I’d get the money back, but I’d love to meet this person, if only to ask ‘why’. Of all the things you could buy with money that isn’t your own, why fricking Minecraft? Maybe, because I don’t play Minecraft myself, I’m missing the appeal, but of all the things you could do… Minecraft. And theme parks. And jokes. And porn. Yep. He’s definitely a teenager.\\n\\nI’m definitely an immature older person too, though I’m not much for online gaming where you need to upgrade or add to what you have. It was just the first thought that struck me when I saw the charges! I mean jeez, buy a friggin’ flatscreen or something!',\n",

       " 'Yesterday, I was permanently banned from a site that calls themselves a butch-femme site.\\n\\nNow, this is a site that is owned and operated by a femme and it *used* to be a place for butches and femmes to meet, chat, flirt, or just hang out with one another. But as the TransCult has swept the nation, so has it swept that site, making it a transgender site now.\\n\\nOk, first, don’t get me started on what I think about women who think they are men but instead of hanging out with straight people on straight sites, they take over a lesbian site and make their home there. I get it, they are still female and straight women want dick. It’s just a fact of life. It doesn’t make straight women bigots for wanting dick, it just makes them, you guessed it, straight women!\\n\\nHence why these women who call themselves men don’t hang out with the straight crowd is pretty clear: they. Are. Not. Men! So, they fall back onto what they know: lesbians. Because we lesbians, we women, have to take in everyone. We cant just be a bunch of lesbians on a lesbian site hanging out and having fun. NO! We have to let in the female transgenders and then cater to them by calling all butches “he” because, we don’t know, maybe that butch over there has decided that “he” is a man now!\\n\\nSo fucking ridiculous. Seriously.\\n\\nConsequently, slowly, over time, all of these females, these women, who call themselves men or call themselves “male ID’d butches” (an oxymoron if I’ve ever heard one!) take over the site and the femmes there let it happen and just shift their focus from butches to these man wannabes. Suddenly it’s a trans-femme site, instead of a butch-femme site. Which is also ridiculous because femmes don’t partner with men, whether they are biological men or women who call themselves men. With a few exceptions (femmes partnering with other femmes, butches partnering with other butches). Femmes partner with butches and butches partner with femmes. Neither are, want to be, or want to be *with* men.\\n\\nI guess I’m saying that it was no great loss to be banned from the site since it was all trans, all the time and those of us who mourned the loss of the butch-femme site had to keep it to ourselves; and believe me, sister, there are a LOT of unhappy campers on your site who wish it wasn’t a transgender site but a site for actual butches and femmes! I’m hearing from them!\\n\\nBut I digress, because here’s what really gets me about being banned from the site. Here is the part that should make every woman’s blood boil: she banned me from the site because of what I said on ANOTHER site! Even though I held my tongue and played nice on her site, not breaking any rules and even being helpful by keeping track of all of the name changes that go on there, because I spoke some truths about transgenders on youtube (my vlog posts), I was labeled a transphobe, “not safe,” and banned from her site.\\n\\nThis is the big take away here: a Woman silenced another Woman, not only for the sake of transgenders, but because she caught the woman saying things with which she didn’t agree on *another site.* She banned a woman from her site because of the OPINIONS that woman expressed on another site!\\n\\nThis is how far we’ve come, dear reader! Women not only silencing other women for the sake of men, but now also for the sake of “men!” Transgender egos are so very fragile that they cannot handle the truth coming at them from anywhere and demand that we are obedient to them on every site on the internet, lest we be banned from a site over which they have complete control. Control based on fear and stupidity. Fear that if one does not agree with them, one will be shunned and branded a bigot, or worse, the slur, “TERF;” and stupidity because I just find it stupid that women would (a) center their lives on men and (b) enable transgenders delusions instead of embracing the truth.',\n",

It feels weird to be sat at my desk again typing and hoping that maybe someone finds me interesting enough to read whatever drivel spills out of my messy brain.\\n\\nLet’s start with why I stopped blogging:\\nBasically I didn’t have the time. I stopped watching youtube and all the things i used to do purely because I didn’t have the time. I started pantomime rehearsals, I swapped friend groups and started going to parties and stuff and exam stress set in and I found it hard to make time for this any more.\\nWith blogging however, it was always a little more. It was important for me. It was helpful. This site is like a support network and writing was a release. There were people here who were in the same position as me and it was nice to talk to them. And I have missed that. I have also missed writing. I stopped because I didn’t feel I was any good at it. In school I didn’t like English so I thought I was a useless writer. I also didn’t need the release so much anymore. I started to get better. I pulled myself up. I got more confident and for a while I had to be selfish and focus on me. It was a delicate time. I knew how easy it would be for me to fall back and lose my confidence and I had to change what I surrounded myself with. No YouTube no WordPress. I had to force myself to go outside.\\n\\nNow let’s do why I’m back:\\nQuite simply because I enjoy being here (virtually). Recently I’ve been getting a lot of comments on how much people have enjoyed my last few posts (specifically the running one – yes I get it, we like to laugh at my expense, I’m hilarious, I’m north yorkshire’s answer to Miranda) and that’s kind of encouraged me to pursue my writing – thank you kind people for your encouraging words on how funny it is when I make a fool of myself in public. Also, in my mock exams I did really well in English. Really well, and I was really fucking proud, because I thought it was like my second weakest subject. I’ve kind of got to the point where I don’t really give a shit about what people have to say about me. I used to care so much when the “popular” girls took the piss out of me for having a blog and I used to let it get to me. Now, with only 4 months left at school with those bitches I don’t care what they say because I know whatever I set my mind to, I will succeed.

Be back soon to update y’all on the recent occurrences in my life because right now I’m sat in the pitch black of my room, only illuminated by my laptop screen when I should really be asleep…\\n\\nI’m praying this snow will lay and get thicker so I don’t have to go into school tomorrow and explain to my English teacher who hates my guts why I haven’t done her homework that was due in today and tell my maths teacher that I didn’t do her homework because she set it yesterday, I didn’t have the desire nor the time to do it, and that the main reason I haven’t done it is because she’s an incompetent fool who I don’t have the time of day for.\",\n",

       " 'San Diego Democrats: Impeach Bush\\n\\nThe San Diego County Democratic Party Central Committee passed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld for \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\\n\\nThe committee, in a vote Tuesday, asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings based on \"evidence\" that the administration lied to the American people and created a false justification for going to war in Iraq.\\n\\nThe resolution refers to the so-called Downing Street Memo – official minutes of a meeting between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of the Bush administration – and \"new leaks of British documents.\"\\n\\nThe resolution says the Downing Street Memo \"reveals that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld began planning and executing war on Iraq before seeking Congressional and U.N. approval\" and fixed intelligence and facts around the policy \"with full knowledge that no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq had been found.\"\\n\\nThe \"new leaks of British documents,\" the resolution says, \"provide further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about \\'mushroom clouds,\\' \\'connections to 9-11,\\' and \\'war as a last resort\\' as they sought United Nations, congressional and public approvals.\"\\n\\nThe committee also calls on the California Democratic Central Committee to adopt the resolution.\\n\\nA local blogger, who first publicized the resolution, commented: \"In the 2004 Presidential Election, Bush beat Kerry in San Diego County by six percentage points. Regardless of how they feel about the Iraq War, local Democrats should be working on outreach, not pushing away potential crossover voters. Dumb, dumb, dumb.\"\\n\\nIn June, Democratic members of Congress held an unofficial hearing on Capitol Hill to draw attention to the memos. In a jammed room in the basement of the Capitol, Representative John Conyers Jr., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, presided as witnesses asserted the documents vindicated their view that Bush made the decision to topple former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein long before he has admitted.\\n\\nThere were calls for impeachment at the hearing.\\n\\nThe White House maintains that Bush decided to invade Iraq only after Secretary of State Colin Powell made the administration\\'s case in a lengthy presentation to the U.N. Security Council on Feb. 5, 2003. His argument focused on intelligence demonstrating that Iraq had illicit weapons.\\n\\nAs WorldNetDaily reported, many of the same weblogs that successfully challenged Dan Rather\\'s documents questioned whether the Downing Street memos are for real.\\n\\nThe controversy seems to be reaching a fever pitch when Times of London reporter Michael Smith admitted the memos he used in his stories are not originals, but copies he retyped.\\n\\n\"Until tonight ... no one questioned the authenticity of the documents provided by the Times of London,\" said CaptainsQuartersBlog, one of the sites behind the Rather scandal. \"That has now changed, as Times reporter Michael Smith admitted that the memos he used are not originals, but retyped copies.\\n\\nThe CaptainsQuartersBlog said that even if the memos could be authenticated, \"they\\'re still meaningless.\" That they simply do not contain any smoking-gun evidence of lies by the Bush administration or the British government of Tony Blair.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed the authenticity of a Downing Street memo in which Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, tells Mr Blair that the Bush administration was \"fixing\" the intelligence and facts about Saddam Hussein\\'s regime to back up a decision that had been taken to invade Iraq as early as July 2002.\\n\\nJune 15 - Two senior British government officials today acknowledged as authentic a series of 2002 pre-Iraq war memos stating that Saddam Hussein\\'s nuclear weapons program was \"effectively frozen\" and that there was \"no recent evidence\" of Iraqi ties to international terrorism—private conclusions that contradicted two key pillars of the Bush administration\\'s public case for the invasion in March 2003.\\n\\nYou know, this is another attempt to change the subject and discredit the people in this country who want to know the truth. Life must be getting uncomfortable indeed for the cabal if they\\'re scrambling this hard.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed the authenticity of a Downing Street memo in which Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, tells Mr Blair that the Bush administration was \"fixing\" the intelligence and facts about Saddam Hussein’s regime to back up a decision that had been taken to invade Iraq as early as July 2002.\\n\\nThe Downing Street memo which was leaked to the Sunday Times newspaper in May 2005 has become a critical issue in the US. Senators Kennedy and Kerry have joined the escalating debate by writing to the President asking whether or not the memo was authentic and accurate. Downing Street has previously refused to comment on the memo’s authenticity, but challenged for the first time on the floor of the House of Commons the Prime Minister has finally confirmed its authenticity.\\n\\nSpeaking after Prime Minister’s Questions, Adam Price MP said:\\n\\n\"The confirmation that the memo is authentic will cause ripples throughout the United States where 122 Members of the US Congress have written to the President asking if Sir Richard Dearlove’s statement in the memo, that ’the intelligence and the facts are being fixed around the policy’ is correct.\\n\\nAlso, see:\\nCover story: The road to war\\nRobin Cook, the former foreign secretary, is publishing the diary he kept as a cabinet minister while Tony Blair prepared to lead Britain to war in Iraq. In a devastating revelation, the prime minister\\'s real views on Saddam\\'s weapons are exposed\\n\\nWilliam Kristol\\'s at it again, see below link to July 12th, 2005 letter... his PNAC \"think tank\" commands always result in more war violence.

The minute the decline of Rove began more than half America {or more now} asked, “Well, how are they going to play it to get out of this?

       " 'Tag Archives: Alka-Seltzer\\n\\n“Either you got a boob job or you are prego. Your boobs look HUGE!” Lynn announces. It was the end of a busy night at the restaurant where I waited tables and I was hunched over wiping down a shelf full of condiments. I took a deep breath, put down the mini mustard and say to Lynn, “Unless the University is giving out student vouchers for books and a boob job, I think it’s safe to say I must be prego.”\\n\\nLynn’s face turned the color of the ketchup I was wiping and I could have swept the floor with her jaw. Normally I would have fallen over laughing at her reaction, but I had only known that I was unexpectedly expecting a baby for a few weeks, and I was still busy picking my own jaw up off the floor.\\n\\nThat was four years and nine months ago, but lately I have noticed an influx of my friends and acquaintances who have come down with a case of the “Unexpected Pregnancy,” or they, like my friend Lynn said upon finding out I was pregnant, “got knocked the fu$k up!” I would like to point out that I am intentionally not using the expression “Unplanned Pregnancy.” I imagine that those are words that are most often whispered by not so well-meaning individuals around water coolers and hors d’oeuvre tables. “Unplanned Pregnancy,” is an expression that implies some sort inherent flaw in the mother to be, as if she was too callous and/or lazy to bother planning her pregnancy. I prefer the expression “Unexpected Pregnancy.” It sounds like a zany surprise, a last-minute house guest, or a freak weather pattern, and best of all there is no judgment. I mean, an unexpected house guest could happen to any one of us.\\n\\nSo now that we have the terminology down, I’d like to share a few of the things I learned during my own unexpected experience. Here is what NOT to do when you are expecting: please, please, please, for the love of God, do not go out and buy that book, “What to Expect When You’re Expecting.” If you insist on buying it please read it slowly and sparingly, not obsessively and compulsively, like I did. Let me be clear, this book could scare the maternity jeans off even the most courageous mom-to-be. “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” is a bunch of prego-elitist fear mongering and no matter how much I bitch, I’ll never get back that hours of sleep and general sense of peace I lost due to reading that book. The text will go into long detail about birth defects that effect something like one in every one million babies that are born under a full moon. Then it will heap on guilt and have you believe that if your baby did have this rarest of birth defects it would most certainly be your fault. Everything from Alka-Seltzer to zucchini is hypothesized to have some adverse effect to your unborn child. “What to Expect” will make you feel confused, paranoid and completely inadequate, and these are two areas in which pregnant women need no additional help.\\n\\nNow, what TO do (the very, very abbreviated version): Go ahead and get over all your preconceived notions of what a mom should be, which are probably based on what your mom was (or was not) and what society says a mom should be. Guess what? This is your experience, your life, and you get to determine what kind of mom you want to be. You want to make casseroles in your Manolo Blahnik’s? You want to make organic casseroles in your Tom’s? You never want the word casserole mentioned again in your presence? Great, fine, whatever, because you are in charge now and this is one of the few perks of being an adult.\\n\\nImmediately after this first step, proceed to step two: get over all your fears, insecurities and doubts about your ability as a mother. So, you’re unmarried? So, you don’t have the perfect job? So, none of your friends have kids? So you are afraid you don’t have a maternal bone in your body? So, your friends don’t quite trust you with their house plants let alone their children, your idea of cooking is a microwave chicken pot pie and you find the idea of breast-feeding simply repulsive? Well, this is my advice: So what? Really, it does not matter.\\n\\nLine up all those feeling of inadequacy, look ‘em in their beady lil eyes and say, “So what?” Because, you are about to live outside of what you ever thought yourself capable of and you will look back and say to yourself, “damn, I did that!” Sounds deceptively simple, but make no mistake it’s actually one of the most difficult things I’ve ever faced. But it’s worth it.\\n\\nTake it from me, an admittedly somewhat selfish girl who found herself: pregnant, unmarried, in a dead-end relationship, with no nearby family, a waitress, a college student, with little to no personal example of what being a good mother was, and with the strong suspicion that I had accumulated enough liquor over the years that milk would immediately curdle upon making contact with my breasts, it is very much worth it.\\n\\nThere is a sign above my son’s bed that says, “I am a Dream Come True.” The thing is, when he first came into my life I didn’t know this, but now I know there are no words that are truer.\\n\\nAnd my last piece of advice is: what you should expect while you are unexpectedly expecting is that you will rise to the occasion of creating the perfect situation for you and your loved ones, as only you can do.',\n",

Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)  3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)  Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)  JESUS F***ING CHRIST.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown.

       " 'Why indeed should you take up the grave task of reverting the site\\'sadministrators. Many have tried it before you, and most of them have failed miserably, but don\\'t despair you hopeful ones, I am going to give you perfect, well balanced reasoning as to Why?:Reverting the administrators is the best idea ever.\\n\\nFirst off before you do a single fucking revert, I want you to understand you will most likely be banned for life, if you practice this too frequently. And rest assured I will not be held responsible for your life long ban in any way, shape or form.\\n\\nSo lets get down to it shall we?\\n\\nContents\\n\\nYou\\'re pissed at the site\\'s administration\\n\\nThose admins are fucking stupid, all they do is ban, ban, ban and huff, huff, huff like there is no tomorrow. Seems obvious then that the best way to get back at them is to revert them every time they try and contribute to the site eh?\\n\\nIt\\'s not only this, but if youdoalotofsitemaintenance without being given any thanks what so ever, you know how frustrating it is that the admins just sit and do nothing for you whilst you clean up the mess of the wankers. All they have to do is ban them, which is quick and easy. Maybe it\\'s time to stop being the pawns on some dumb guys\\' chess-sets and rise up to your oppressors!\\n\\nBut not only that, the wankers won\\'t even let you go for adminship when the opportunity pops up. They simply say lol no and give promises of allowing the vote in the following month. And even when it eventually does run, they won\\'t vote for you ever. Losers.\\n\\nSo it seems that those admins are slippery fuckers, loyal to no-one and only interested in suppressing you further down the totem pole. I think reverting their contributions ought to put them back in their place.\\n\\nThe revert\\n\\nAll right, rather than continuing to be suppressed by self-important, 40 year old virgins, who still live with their mothers, you have chosen to actually fight the fuckers. Well done!\\n\\nBut know when to draw the line, know that in some cases reverting it may break the site entirely, this is not only bad for everyone but it will affect you. And will most likely result in your IP being banhammered as well. Thus disallowing anything to chance.\\n\\nMake sure no-one\\'s looking\\n\\nThis is not rocket science! Certain individuals are real suck ups to the admins, as they aspire to be one themselves one day. If they spot you doing this while interrupting their precious masturbation time, they will revert it right back and most likely notify an admin so they can ban you. So it\\'s simple, wait for an ideal time window where no-one is awake to make your edit. That way it gets swept off Recent Changes along with the rest of the vandalism.\\n\\nREVERT AWAY!\\n\\nMission accomplished.\\n\\nWell what the fuck are you waiting for? No-one is watching, revert the fucker before someone does notice. For proper effect, make a lot of minor edits to sweep the revert off of recent changes which will decrease your chances of being caught. But if you want to get caught, feel free to revert everything you see until you get banned for life.\\n\\nReverting under multiple accounts is strongly discouraged here, as it is likely they will block your IP for abusing multiple accounts. If you insist on doing this though I will not be held responsible for the outcome, in fact I will not be held responsible for the outcome of trying any of this in any way, shape or form.\\n\\nIf you have noticed some loser has reverted you back, then don\\'t go back to the page and undo it again, that wastes precious nanoseconds. Just move onto your next article. Remember, you\\'re only here to teach the fuckers a lesson.\\n\\nRun like fuck\\n\\nThat\\'s my only advice.\\n\\nThe aftermath\\n\\nBlock\\'d!\\n\\nYou can still read pages, but cannot edit, change, alter, modify, emend, revise, or create them.\\n\\nIt might be possible to plead your case over IRC, if you didn\\'t do anything really wrong, or if you can prove that you have fully educated yourself by reading the above articles. Log into the Uncyclopedia channel with the same username you use here, and start begging. Bring flowers, a positive attitude, and a cheery hello. None of those will help, but occasionally admins take pity on banees. (Often just before they get fired for being softies.)\\n\\n↑Seriously. If you can\\'t prove you know the basic rules and what we\\'re trying to do here, you\\'ll find the admins more than a bit chilly.\\n\\n↑Note that you may not use the \"email this user\" feature unless you have a valid email address registered in your user preferences. Also, don\\'t email every admin unless you want the ban quadrupled (or worse).',\n",

She feels no emotions and so she isn\\'t governed by them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the Lord Conqueror did marry the Queen,\" argued Domitia.\\n\\n\"She only married her concubine to spite us, to show us who truly rules the Empire. It is common knowledge even amongst complete idiots!\"\\n\\nNobleman Marton turned to Nobleman Verosus and said, \"We must consider the possibility that the Conqueror didn\\'t take this silly girl over here because she realized it was all a ploy.\"\\n\\n\"By the Gods… what shall we do? Should we run?\" Terror began to tighten its grip over Nobleman Verosus and he began fidgeting like a skittish horse.\\n\\n\"We are governors, we can\\'t just disappear. Besides, there is no escaping the Conqueror. There is no place to hide, no place out of the Conqueror\\'s reach. If we run now, the Conqueror will know we\\'re guilty. Let me think…\" Nobleman Marton said.\\n\\nAfter some time had elapsed in silence with both men pacing restlessly from wall to wall, Nobleman Marton continued: \"Lady Messalina won\\'t say anything. She\\'s neck deep in this and she has too much to lose.\"\\n\\n\"The Lord Conqueror knows nothing more than my name, and I am hardly the only Domitia in the Realm,\" she said. \"And I wore nothing that would imply my station.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very good. We might just come out of it alive,\" he said.\\n\\n***\\n\\nTwo days had gone by. The Conqueror and the Queen were taking a stroll in the Imperial gardens, near the lily pond that the Queen adored so much. As they walked together side by side, enjoying the morning sun, the odor of blossoms and the light exercise, Gabrielle recalled the days when she had been a slave. How she used to walk in these magnificent gardens, trying to understand her Lord\\'s moods and actions. It felt like a lifetime ago. As if to remind herself that she was in a different place now, that those days were over, Gabrielle reached for her Lord and interlaced her arm with the Conqueror\\'s.\\n\\n\"They are all waiting for us in the Great Hall,\" Gabrielle said.\\n\\n\"Let them wait,\" the Conqueror smiled and looked at her Queen, while pressing a gentle hand over the pregnant Queen\\'s back for support.\\n\\n\"There is one thing that isn\\'t clear to me, why didn\\'t Lady Messalina wait until after nightfall to tell me about the girl?\"\\n\\n\"Whoever set this entire subterfuge didn\\'t take two things into account. I wasn\\'t familiar with the informant that disclosed Perous\\' whereabouts. I wasn\\'t sure whether I could trust him or not, and I wasn\\'t about to march blindly into a trap on the \\'say so\\' of an informant I knew nothing about. First, I sent a scout to check the area and to confirm that Perous was indeed there and that he was alone. That took time,\" explained the Conqueror.\\n\\n\"And the second thing?\"\\n\\n\"That I would return from Cyra alone and leave my forces behind… My desire to see you was too great. I couldn\\'t wait.\"\\n\\nThe Queen rose to stand on her toes and placed a warm heartfelt kiss on the Conqueror\\'s jaw, the highest place she could reach.\\n\\n\"You know, my Lady, you are the Realm\\'s Sovereign.\"\\n\\n\"I know, my Lord,\" the Queen said and wondered why her Lord chose this time to remind her of that fact.\\n\\n\"And Lady Messalina is one of your ladies in waiting. She is your responsibility,\" the Conqueror said.\\n\\nThe reason for the Conqueror\\'s words began to become apparent and clear to her. \"I assume treason is punishable by death, my Lord?\"\\n\\n\"It is, my Lady.\"\\n\\nAs they were nearing the gates of the palace, the Queen turned to the Conqueror, \"My Lord?\"\\n\\n\"Hmmm…?\"\\n\\n\"Death is the most sever penalty for treason, is it not?\" the Queen asked.\\n\\nThe Conqueror smiled for she understood the meaning and the reason for the Queen\\'s question.\\n\\n\"It is, my Lady.\"\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"The Lord Conqueror and her Majesty the Queen,\" the ceremony master announced as the Conqueror and the Queen entered the Great Hall.\\n\\nAs the Conqueror and the Queen made their way to their thrones, all present in the Great Hall bowed before them until they reached their destination and seated themselves.\\n\\n\"Noblemen and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror exclaimed, \"We have summoned you all here due to a grave matter which has come to our attention and requires further investigation.\"\\n\\nThe noblemen and the ladies of the Realm began to look at one another agitatedly to see if anyone had any idea as to what the Conqueror was referring to.\\n\\n\"Lady Messalina,\" the Queen called.\\n\\nLady Messalina approached the thrones. \"Your Majesties,\" she said and bowed before them.\\n\\nAs she stood before them, the Conqueror leaned over and whispered something in the Queen\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"Lady Messalina, is it not true that just before noon on the day of my Lord\\'s return from Cyra, you informed me that a young lass had been seen entering the Imperial tent?\"\\n\\nLady Messalina\\'s blood drained from her face and she grew as pale as a sheet. \"It is true, your Majesty,\" she admitted.\\n\\n\"And how did you come by this bit of information?\" the Queen inquired further.\\n\\n\"I… I can\\'t remember, your Majesty,\" replied the nervous lady.\\n\\n\"Is it not true, that the lass in question is your very own daughter?\"\\n\\nLady Messalina nearly fainted. The crowd around her gasped in surprise and walked backwards away from her, as if trying to disassociate themselves from her.\\n\\n\"It is, your Majesty.\" At this stage, lady Messalina had already realized there was no point in lying.\\n\\n\"Was it not your intention to cause dispute between my Lord and myself?\"\\n\\nLady Messalina threw herself at the Queen\\'s feet and began kissing them.\\n\\n\"You will stand up,\" the Queen ordered and her assertiveness gave pause to her subjects.\\n\\nLady Messalina rose back to her feet.\\n\\n\"You will answer the question.\"\\n\\n\"I will your Majesty,\" Lady Messalina replied.\\n\\n\"Did you act on your own volition?\"\\n\\n\"No, your Majesty.\"\\n\\n\"Who put you up to this?\" asked the Queen.\\n\\n\"Please, your gracious Majesty, I beg you please don\\'t make me…\"\\n\\n\"Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton!\" the Conqueror exclaimed.\\n\\nBoth men made their way through the crowd, mortified, joined their accomplice and bowed before the thrones.\\n\\n\"What have you got to say for yourselves?\" the Conqueror\\'s voice was ominous.\\n\\n\"Indeed not, but when her Majesty the Queen asked the question, Lady Messalina threw a glance at the two of you,\" said the Conqueror. \"That confirmed my suspicions.\"\\n\\nNoblemen Marton and Verosus confessed to the specifics of their scheme for all to hear by orders of the Conqueror, without trying to cast responsibility at one another and minimizing their own involvement in the traitorous conspiracy.\\n\\n\"Is my Lady prepared to render her verdict in the matter of Lady Messalina?\" the Conqueror asked.\\n\\n\"I am, my Lord,\" the Queen replied.\\n\\n\"Lady Messalina, you have handled yourself poorly and reprehensibly. Being a Queen\\'s lady in waiting is a sacred duty. It has been proven to my satisfaction that you have betrayed that duty and my trust. You have been disloyal to me and disloyal to my Lord and to the Realm. You\\'ve tried by despicable means to come between my Lord and myself. This offense I cannot and will not pardon. However, I am satisfied that there are mitigating circumstances since you were extorted. Desperation deprives some of rational thought and behooves them to take desperate measures. Therefore, it is my verdict that you should be stripped of your station and be banished from the Realm forthwith for my Lord\\'s pleasure.\" The Queen voice was steady, firm and confident.\\n\\n\"Noblemen Marton and Verosus, greed and malice are no defense against treason. Your actions solicited, financed and facilitated an act of rebellion against us and against this Realm, which resulted in the death of several subjects and warriors of the Realm. Moreover, you have extorted her Majesty the Queen\\'s lady in waiting and exploited her innocent daughter. You and your families will be stripped of your station and possessions. Marton and Verosus, you shall suffer a quick death in three days time. As for Macedonia , I hereby appoint Lila of Potidaea as the new governor to Macedonia and a Lady of this Realm. As for Philippi, I hereby appoint her Majesty the Queen\\'s lady in waiting, Satrina, as the new governor to Philippi, if it pleases you, your Majesty,\" the Conqueror asked the Queen.\\n\\n\"It does, my gracious Lord,\" smiled the Queen.\\n\\nAs the guards came to remove the condemned men from the Great Hall, Lady Satrina scurried to bow before the Conqueror and the Queen.\\n\\n\"Your Majesties, I cannot thank you enough for your infinite kindness, honor and generosity your Majesties have shown me, and I am grateful with all my heart and soul for the great trust you place in me, but I pray you, if I may,\" she said and her excitement was evident in her voice.\\n\\n\"You may,\" granted the Queen.\\n\\n\"With your Majesties\\' permission, and if it pleases you, I wish to remain in her Majesty the Queen\\'s presence and service for I am so very contented and happy with my life here in the palace,\" she said. \"I could not have hoped to serve a kinder, nobler Sovereign than our benevolent Queen.\"\\n\\nThe Queen glanced over at the Conqueror with questioning eyes and the Conqueror, who was the one who first granted the honor, nodded her consent. Their subjects could not help but notice the silent exchange between them.\\n\\n\"As you wish, Lady Satrina and thank you,\" the Queen said and did her best to remain formal and regal and not let her own excitement be known in the forum.\\n\\n\"Captain Cornelius of the Imperial Guard,\" announced the ceremony master.\\n\\nThe Queen wasn\\'t familiar with the name.\\n\\nWith wide determined strides, fitting a military man, Captain Cornelius approached the thrones and bowed before his Rulers.\\n\\n\"Your Majesties,\" he greeted.\\n\\nIt was then that the Queen recognized whom he was and fought an urge to move uncomfortably on her throne.\\n\\n\"With your permission, your Majesty,\" he humbly said and turned his attention to the Queen.\\n\\n\"Granted,\" said the Queen.\\n\\n\"I come before your gracious Majesty, a humble servant, to beg for forgiveness. In the past your Majesty showed me great kindness and granted excellent remedy, which I, I am ashamed to say, repaid with gross disrespect.\"\\n\\nHe chose this grand forum to offer his genuine remorse, rather than offer his apologies in private. In his mind, since he disrespected the Queen in the presence of the healer and others in the infirmary, it was only just that he should surrender his pride to the Queen in public.\\n\\nHe was also careful not to divulge any specifics of his transgression, including the fact that he was referring to the times back when the Queen had been a slave, so as not to cause the Queen either discomfort or embarrassment.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say, I was foolish and a proud brute and I know in my heart I am not worthy of your Majesty\\'s pardon. I assure your Majesty that as a result of your Majesty\\'s dignity, generosity and supreme conduct towards me, which I didn\\'t deserve I have mended my ways. I submit myself before you, your Majesty to punish as your Majesty deems fit,\" he said and knelt before the Queen.\\n\\n\"Stand up, Captain,\" she ordered and he obeyed.\\n\\n\"Your past misdeeds towards me are pardoned,\" the Queen said, then covered her mouth and whispered a private question in her Lord\\'s ear, to which the latter nodded her agreement.\\n\\n\"You have exhibited candor and great honor, which leads me to believe your repentance is true and sincere. I hereby appoint you a nobleman to the Realm and a governor to Philippi ,\" the Queen said.\\n\\nHe lowered his head in humility and thanked his Queen for the bounty she had bestowed upon him.\\n\\n\"That concludes our business here today, Nobleman and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror stated, stood up and offered her arm to assist her pregnant Queen to her feet.\\n\\nStanding in front of their subjects, the Conqueror went on to say, \"As I trust you all know, today I have shown great leniency towards Marton and Verosus for their appalling treachery. By no means must you perceive it as any form of a precedent. I shall see no further division in this Realm.\"\\n\\nAs the Queen and her Lord made their way out of the Great Hall, their subjects bowed before them then began clapping their hands and chanting, \" Hail to the Queen. \"\\n\\nWhilst strolling along the corridor that led to the Imperial chambers, the curious Queen asked, \"How did my Lord know that the lass in Cyra was Messalina\\'s daughter?\"\\n\\n\"They have the same shade of hair color and the shape of their eyes and chins are exactly alike,\" the Conqueror explicated.\\n\\nAlone in the privacy of their chambers, the Conqueror turned to her Queen took her small hands in hers and said with bright eyes, \"I am so very proud of you, my Lady,\" and adorned the thin fingers with tender kisses.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAfter three days had passed, Marton and Verosus were brought to the gallows upon a wagon, which resembled one that was fit to carry small livestock. In the square stood a large crowd, as with any execution. The Conqueror always believed that even regular people, non-warriors were fascinated by death and were curious to see life as it was leaving the body. If someone else did the actual killing, then all the better.\\n\\nHeavily guarded, the two men were escorted up the podium to face their Ruler and executioner. Verosus\\'s neck was first to be stretched out and presented before the Conqueror.\\n\\nAs he was waiting, trembling on his knees and mumbling unintelligible words, the Conqueror unsheathed her sword, which was resting over her chiseled thigh in a leather scabbard. The polished, long and well-whetted blade caught the sun\\'s rays.\\n\\nThe crowed cursed at the condemned men and cheered for their Sovereign, goading her on. It wasn\\'t a novelty. The Conqueror knew that once she would lay the deadly strike, the cheers and the cursing would halt.\\n\\nWith one strike, the Conqueror put an end to his mumbling, and his severed head rolled over the floor of the podium, which was covered with sawdust to absorb the spilt blood, and his headless corpse slumped to the ground next to it.\\n\\nThen came Marton\\'s turn. Before he was shoved down to his knees by the guards and into his accomplice\\'s pool of freshly spilt blood, the Conqueror leaned slightly towards him and whispered into his ear: “You do realize this is not retribution for some silly, inconsequential rebellion, which could have been handled quickly by a single battalion of my forces. This is mainly for trying to come between me and my Queen.”\\n\\nHis shocked expression was still frozen on his face when the Conqueror removed his head from his shoulders.\\n\\nAs the Conqueror wiped the blood off her sword and looked at Marton\\'s head next to her boots, her mind strayed back to another execution which she had performed, the one of the British Captain, who had raped and killed some body slave, whose name the Conqueror couldn\\'t even remember now.\\n\\nBefore she had sent him to his death, the Conqueror had desired to make it perfectly clear to the Captain the true and exact reason for his chastisement. When he had extended his head forward before her, whilst on his knees, she\\'d hissed at him, “This is for putting your filthy hands on what\\'s mine. The slave you\\'ve raped and killed was just an excuse.”',\n",

I follow him on Twitter, and it’s all love.\"\\n\\nRose and Qerim went public with their relationship during this past summer.\\n\\nRose probably felt the need to address his feelings about the record and Em\\'s comments towards Qerim, in particular, due to the bars the rapper dedicated to the First Take moderator on \"Campaign Speech.\"\\n\\n\"But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer \\'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them,\" Em rhymes on the record. \"Molly, I’m gone off you/Man, light some kush/You’re my first take, I’ll nail you/Can’t lie, I gush/If I won you over, you would be the grand prize/I’m entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push/You can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch/Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush/Mushed against your damn side, your p***/And thighs are squished…\"\\n\\nEven when Rose\\'s podcast collaborator prodded him to admit that he felt a type of way hearing those lyrics about his girlfriend, Jalen didn\\'t budge.\\n\\n\"As somebody that’s fortunate enough to be name-checked on the record, it’s about who’s shouting you out,\" he said. \"And so, I actually heard the record not knowing that she was going to be name-checked in it.

(Second to right in the above photo.) Just as the band\\'s publicist was about to connect Rush with the 19-year-old, she very quickly, and rather casually, rattled off a list of \"few things you\\'re not allowed to ask.\"\\n\\nExcept there weren\\'t a \"few things.\" There were many things. Twelve. Actually, 13, since the last one\\'s a two-parter.\\n\\nThe forbidden list:\\n\\n1. Who is your celebrity crush?\\n2. Which of you have girlfriends?\\n3. Who came up with the name One Direction?\\n4. Anything \"X Factor\"-related\\n5. Worst habits about each other\\n6. Do you guys fight?\\n7. Best prank someone pulled on you\\n8. Describe each other in one word\\n9. Funniest fan stories\\n10. If not in the band, what would you be doing?\\n11. Pre-show rituals\\n12. No questions about money or religion\\n\\nBy this instruction, questions completely within bounds would have been: When did you lose your virginity?; Have you ever huffed paint?; Who does your eyebrows?; How often do you give your bandmates blowies?\\n\\nRush, in turn, did what any self-respecting Grown Man Who Really Doesn\\'t Need This Shit from a Stupid Teenager would do. He said hello to Zayn, audibly shuffled some papers, then said goodbye.\\n\\n\"I have never in my career experienced anything remotely close to this,\" writes Rush, who\\'s been doing this sort of thing for more than 15 years, over e-mail. He acknowledges what anyone who\\'s ever dealt with celebrity publicists knows: they sometimes will ask you to avoid one or two \\'sensitive\\' topics; whether you oblige is your choice, but disobedience will inevitably affect future access to their clients. \"Zayn is apparently dating a girl named Perrie from a girl-band in England. If I had been told not to ask about her because he\\'s uncomfortable talking about it, that would have been fine,\" Rush concedes. \"They took it a mile further, which is why we did what we did. I could have done a full interview with Zayn and not touched on any of the banned subjects-I was certainly prepared-but come on. Sometimes you just have to say enough is enough.\"\\n\\nOn Monday, Rush\\'s show (\"The Morning Hot Tub with Mauler, Rush, Jenni and Josie\") aired the conversation, complete with the Sony Music Canada flak\\'s verboten-subject introduction. The label wasn\\'t happy. \"They seemed rather upset and asked us to remove the audio of the interview from our website.\" The station complied, Rush explains, because \"we wanted to make a point, the point was made, and there was no reason to go any further.\"\\n\\nRegarding the recent story about One Direction \"banning questions\" -this is a complete misunderstanding. One Direction asked if certain recurring questions could be avoided in future interviews as the band were giving the same answers continually. They knew, via feedback, that the fans were requesting a wider range of subject matter in interviews. Questions relating to describing each band member, or referencing The X Factor, are certainly not out of bounds. A suggestion was merely made to try and make interviews more interesting for the fans, which has been misconstrued and misunderstood.\\n\\nIn any case, the original segment is still floating around YouTube.

       " 'Review\\n\\nReview Summary: Legendary album from the ultimate NJ hardcore band. I could say more, but I\\'d be lying if I thought it was necessary.\\n\\nFor me, growing up in New Jersey meant two things: lousy job opportunities and a chance to experience firsthand some legendary music. To be completely fucking honest, Floorpunch are one of those bands that I’d fight someone over. Probably even kill someone. Not because they revitalized youth crew. Not because they were basically the essence of my home state in band form. Hell, not even because their live shows were among the best I’ve ever witnessed. No, it’s just because there isn’t a damned day that goes by when I make music that I don’t think of the incredible influence they’ve had on myself, my friends, and the scene we’ve created for ourselves. It’s not just about the music to me, it’s about the meaning.\\n\\nBut about the music. Floorpunch were one of those straight edge bands who didn’t get all preachy and up their own ass about their beliefs. What they did do, however, was drive a stake of sheer power straight enter your skull with each riff, crash, and yell that consensually rapes (yes) your ears. It’s these elements that make Fast Times At the Jersey Shore such a fun ride. Each song is concise, and straight to the point. No beating around the bush, just angry as hell Jersey hardcore. “Washed Up at 18,” the album’s seminal opener, captures all of Floorpunch’s feelings about their own music and the rest of the album to come in the lyrics sheet: “What you had you were given/You were never a part of our scene” - and that’s that basically. What makes Fast Times so special is Floorpunch’s ability to instantly alienate anyone who may not want to take them seriously. I liken it to the Japanese practice of breeding Kabuki actors to maintain purity on the stage.\\n\\nFast Times also features some of the straight up best hardcore musicianship you will ever hear. Period. You only need to hear the breakdown in “Always” or the ripping bass intro of “The Answer” to catch onto that. What’s particularly unique about this album is the sound is high quality, but maintains a demo-esque feel; the music is heavy and pissed off, but oddly funny- upon repeated listens, you’ll start to suspect that Floorpunch are really just flipping everyone the bird while they do whatever the fuck they want. They take hardcore back to it’s roots while still managing to inflect their own unique take on things. An example of this would be “Let It Ride,” in which Floorpunch merely wanna go gambling in Atlantic City and stare at women, while a choruses of cheers and wolf-whistles backs them up. It’s lead singer’s shout of “One more time,” and a repeat of the verse that makes your musical boner get nice and hard.\\n\\nWhat really makes Fast Times an essential release is its immortal replay ability. Seriously, you could hit shuffle and repeat on this album and listen to it in an infinite variety of combinations and it will never get old. That’s how a good hardcore album should be: a never ending storm of rage and power, but something that you can just connect with. Floorpunch accomplished that here, and whether you like it or not, you probably owe them more than you think because they more than likely changed the course of the lives of the people who formed one of your favorite hardcore bands in at least one way or another. Give credit where it’s due.\\n\\n[quote=review]Floorpunch accomplished that here, and whether you like it or not, you probably owe them more than you think because they more than likely changed the course of the lives of the people who formed your favorite band in one way or another.[/quote]\\nHoly hyperbolic and most likely completely unfounded claims batman!\\n\\ni just messaged rise against and asked if they knew floorpunch. tim messaged back saying yes but none of the original members liked them much, \"plus lifetime filled our slot for jerseycore of course.\" he also invited me to lunch and a sconeparty. at this point the joke is obvious.\\n\\nNonetheless, class review and I\\'m getting this right now.This Message Edited On 01.27.08',\n",

       " \"In Vampyr, the easiest way to level up is by draining someone's blood until they're dead. It's how you get the most XP. Then you go and rest in a safe location, absorbing the energy and growing your powers. This is such a natural and logical way to do 'being a vampire in a game' it's surprising it hasn't been widely used already.\\n\\nIt's not quite as simple as that, though. Shitty people have shitty blood, so you'll get less from it, while nice people have delicious, premium gold top blood. This would appear to be a no brainer still, except that the citizens in the different districts of Vampyr's semi-open, distinctly gothic London, are all connected. Killing a nice little old lady who makes medicine for a homeless young man will make the whole district worse off: her house will be looted, aforesaid young man would probably die, and the Spanish flu will spread further, making everyone's blood worse. It could even change the economy.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you could kill her son, a violent murderer. His death would improve the district, but you'd get fewer experience points to boost your power. Essentially the choice is kill one good person to become more powerful but make everything else worse, or kill a lot of awful people and have to put in more effort.\\n\\nDuring the E3 preview presentation, the developers kept saying 'Cursed be the choice,' which is something of a catchphrase for Vampyr's marketing. The reason decisions are presented as so morally troubling is your character: you play as Dr. Jonathan Reid, recently returned from the First World War (although, obviously, at the time they didn't call it that) and even recentlier a vampire. As per his Hippocratic oath, he's not really keen on eating people. But when push comes to shove, he'll have to decide which of the citizens he's trying to protect from the flu are worth sacrificing so he can save the rest. Each neighbourhood in London also has a 'pillar of the community' who keeps things fairly stable, but if, as was the case in the demo, that pillar is an angry Catholic priest who has taken to eating dead flesh, what cost will there be?\\n\\nThis imposition of a moral code is useful when you want the player to think carefully about relentlessly murdering everyone they run into just because they can. I suspect many people, like me, would raise as much hell as possible before giving everyone the finger and backflipping through a plate glass window, yelling 'I'm a vampire, bitches!' on the way out; as Jonathan Reid, however, you're a careful, softly spoken man who cuts a vaguely Holmesian figure in a trench coat, and it's easy to imagine how troubling he finds the new, monstrous side to his personality. God forbid he be impolite to people.\\n\\nInteracting with the citizens is a surprisingly huge part of the game. Every citizen in London has a name and a personal background, with links to the other NPCs. With careful questioning you can discover all these links, winkle out secrets, and find out what blood purity level everyone has — and, consequently, who might be worth a quick bite. The tapestry of London, with all these interwoven threads, is so fascinating that you almost forget the whole, you know, supernatural action RPG thing.\\n\\nReid can't enter houses unless he's been invited in. He can mesmerise humans to try and control them, and see their thudding heartbeats through walls. As he explores London he must contest with other mutated, feral vampires known as Skulls, and vampire hunters calling themselves the Priwen Guard. In combat he combines ranged attacks, melee weapons, and super-special vampire powers that do a range of horrible things involving blood. It moves fast, but seems consequential: the dev playing the demo was keen to avoid being hit, using a lot of dodging.\\n\\nVampyr is going to be compared to the Vampire: The Masquerade games, because Activision's early noughties RPGs are the last vampire games anyone can remember, but right now it's looking entirely different. It's not sexy, streetlamp lit LA, with cool nightclubs inside disused churches, where you can safely drink someone's blood if you chat them up properly. Vampyr is elegant, but still down and dirty: a well-crafted, delicious slice of extra dark chocolate gateau, served by unwashed hands.\\n\\nYou're not happy about being a vampire. You are a lonely man walking the labyrinthine streets of a grimy city ravaged by disease, killing out of necessity rather than for fun. A man who sees the consequences of his actions. Vampyr has multiple endings, and, we are told by a developer, 'You will have the ending you deserve.'\\n\\nVampyr is out on PS4, Xbox One and PC in November 2017.\",\n",

It states:\\n\\n“We need Brie Larson to step down from her role to prove she is an ally of social justice and ensure a gay woman of color plays the role.”\\n\\nThe petition also indicates that Larson “hasn’t donated to any charity other than The Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation.” The petition’s creator notes “it’s time for her to show she is not all-talk.”\\n\\nThe petition has currently been signed by 32 individuals.\\n\\nJohn D. writes, “Because Monica Rambeau is the better version of Captain Marvel.”\\n\\nRob V. says, “Diversity should be real and not an agenda for an actress to preach.”\\n\\nFrank P. adds, “CM should be Monica Rambeau whos hero was her father a New Orleans police officer..”\\n\\nMichael K. writes, “If she cared about diversity why as a white woman did she take a role meant for a black woman.”\\n\\nYouTube commentator Eric July described Marvel’s portrayal of Monica Rambeau in Captain Marvel as racist.\\n\\nJuly stated, ““When it comes to the relationship between Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers in this movie it embodies exactly how white leftists, social justice advocates see themselves.” He continues, “But the complete change of Monica highlights how they can step on black canon if it means they can grandstand or signal.”\\n\\nHe specifically notes why the portrayal of Rambeau in Captain Marvel was racist:\\n\\n“Notice how Monica is a kid right now by the time Endgame drops she will have been an adult right? I’m calling it right now. She will emerge with powers and it will unfortunately be influenced by Carol Danvers as if she had something to do with why she became a hero. Though this is an offensive deviation from the original material that’s the typical elitist white leftist approach. As long as they remain on top, they will pretend they give a damn about their little stupid ass representation. It has to be on their terms. And they have to be the one’s ushering it in to feel good about themselves.”\\n\\nHe adds:\\n\\n“Even though I can argue that what they did to Monica was an act of racism, if we really wanted to make this a battle of the buzz terms. They probably didn’t even realize what they did because it’s so second nature to these fools. You are down there, and they of course think of themselves up here. So, now they are laughing to the bank after they knocked Monica all the way down to this innocent child. An innocent child that looks up to this new hero and the strongest person in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, white blonde woman by the name of Carol Danvers, who is the seventh damn version of Captain Marvel.”\\n\\nWhile July stated Marvel’s portrayal of Monica Rambeau in Captain Marvel is racist, Brie Larson talks about promoting diversity as much as she can in her press engagements.\\n\\nMost recently she appeared on Variety and iHeart Radio’s new podcast,\\n\\n“The Big Cast” where she noted that “we gotta move faster” when it comes to LGBTQ and diversity representation in superhero films.\\n\\nIn fact, it’s not just representation in the films that Larson has been advocating for. She has also made it a point to do press interviews with “diverse” people. Larson stated, “What I’m looking for is to bring more seats up to the table. No one is getting their chair taken away. There’s not less seats at the table, there’s just more seats at the table.”\\n\\nWhat do you make of this petition? Do you think Brie Larson should step down as Captain Marvel? Will you be signing the petition?\\n\\n(Visited 64,372 times, 1 visits today)',\n",
       " 'ANALYSIS/OPINION:\\n\\nAs the fight to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court continues, it is imperative to remember exactly who is trying to destroy him and our system. The so-called establishment elite, left-wing groups who hate this country and our system, Hollywood hypocrites, Republican Never Trumpers and, of course, the Democratic Party having been taken over not just by ignorant socialists, but run by adults who know what they’re doing is wrong and just don’t care.\\n\\nFor generations, liberals have been pointing fingers at conservatives accusing them of whatever awful social crime suits their purpose. Remember — Hollywood has manifested a cottage industry accusing conservatives of sexism and misogyny. These are the same people who ignored and facilitated the monster of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and so many others in that industry.\\n\\nThe reality is this: Conservatives became their stand-in for the bad men that they couldn’t (or wouldn’t) control or stop. After all, you wouldn’t keep working if you went to a rally like Madonna or Ashley Judd and screamed profanities at Mr. Weinstein or threatened to blow up his house. But you could scream at President Trump, unleashing rage at a man who had nothing to do with your suffering, while risking nothing in the meantime.\\n\\nThe attacks on Judge Kavanaugh are of the same sort. On the epidemic of sexual violence and abuse, many women have never received justice or closure. That is an obscenity that must be dealt with. What we’ve seen emerge from the Democrats is now a strategy to use that pain that so many women understand and weaponize it, essentially encouraging women to use Judge Kavanaugh as a stand-in for all perpetrators.\\n\\nIt’s true, too many women have not been heard or believed, and we need to change that, but we’re not going to accomplish anything by becoming fascists and blaming every man for the horrors others have inflicted on us.\\n\\nTV talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, another resident of morally superior Hollywood, contributed to the national discourse about Judge Kavanaugh by saying the high court nominee should have his penis cut off.\\n\\nOne liberal website, the Decider, was surprised conservatives took exception to that suggestion: “But don’t despair: Kimmel has a solution for the ‘political’ fight over Kavanaugh. ‘Hear me out on this,’ said Kimmel. ‘So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK? Well, in return, we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone.’ While many audience members laughed at the suggestion, a few people groaned audibly. ‘No? That’s not good? I thought I had a solution there for a minute,’ he laughed. Immediately after Jimmy Kimmel Live aired, right-wing viewers vented their anger on social media.”\\n\\nLiberals, apparently, not so much.\\n\\nThe insanity, of course, isn’t limited to Hollywood liberals, it has gripped Democrats everywhere. Instead of the accuser presenting testimony detailing her allegations, multiple Democratic senators have stated that it is Judge Kavanaugh’s responsibility to disprove the allegations.\\n\\nThese are the same people who belong to a Congress that has a “shush fund” with which they use tax dollars to pay off sexual and racial harassment claims, without (cough) proving their innocence.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, went out to dinner in Washington, D.C., and were harassed by a group of leftist activists who somehow were allowed to get into the restaurant.\\n\\nThe Daily Mail reported, “An angry mob of protesters hounded Texas Senator Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi in an upscale Washington D.C. restaurant on Monday night, demanding to know his position on Brett Kavanaugh and later threatening him: ‘You are not safe.’\\n\\n“The group, which was made up of activists from Smash Racism DC and a handful of other left wing organizations, ambushed Cruz and his wife at Fiola, an Italian restaurant near the White House …” the newspaper reported. “They … threatened Cruz, the president and ‘any the rest of the racist, sexist, transphobic, and homophobic right-wing scum’ by saying ominously: ‘You are not safe. We will find you.’ “\\n\\nRemember — Democrats and leftists, the people trying to disrupt this nation socially and politically, continue to encourage public harassment of conservatives. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California was simply the first one to directly encourage it. Now, the behavior of the Democrats in the Senate and their representatives on the Judiciary Committee have embraced that call and are modeling it to the nation with their harassment and attempt to destroy Judge Kavanaugh.\\n\\nThese are the people who think conservatives won’t care enough to go to the polls in November. They were wrong in 2016, and now it’s time to prove them wrong again.\\n\\n• Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women’s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk show host.',\n",

That\\'s what biologist Jamie Winters\\nthinks until a gorgeous Greek god enters her life and drowns her, forcing her\\nto rapture into a Siren. Used to logic, she can\\'t quite come to terms with Seth\\nCutter\\'s magical undersea realm or the fact that he\\'s a macho Titan.\\n\\nBeing a Siren causes Jamie\\'s hormones to go into overdrive,\\nwhich isn\\'t good when she realizes that\\'s exactly what Seth was hoping for.\\nSure, the sex is out of this world, but she\\'s not about to change her\\ncharacter.\\n\\nAs Prince of the North Seas, Seth is used to having his\\ncommands followed. A decade of exile on land was easier than having to deal\\nwith the sexy-as-sin Siren who tips the scales of his existence and doesn\\'t listen\\nto one word he says.\\n\\nThey must overcome their prejudices to recover stolen relics\\nthat are key to the undersea kingdom, stop a deadly plague and destroy an\\nunderwater diva who wants to rule the roost. Are they two souls destined for\\neach other or will the Fates decide otherwise? Seth knows firsthand, Fate can\\nbe a bitch.\\n\\nExcerpt:\\n\\nAfter a month\\nworking with Caskett at the Institute of Oceanography, Jamie still took the\\nlong way to get to her desk. She didn’t care if the other researchers teased\\nher for avoiding the elevator, the wharf or any of the vessels berthed at the\\ntwo docks. She simply avoided the people. She had been hired because her\\ncutting-edge research on immunological diseases in sea mammals was excellent.\\nShe knew that and so did the rest of the researchers.\\n\\nNo, there was\\nnothing wrong with taking the scenic route to her office. After all, it was\\nlocated on the basement level and there was no other way unless she took the\\nelevator, which was not going to happen. Highly claustrophobic by nature, she\\navoided elevators at all costs.\\n\\nAt five-thirty\\nin the morning she wasn’t expecting anyone to greet her anyway. Sliding her\\nsecurity card through the outer door’s electronic slot, she then punched in her\\ncode and took the long corridor, which led to Caskett’s floor. She heard the\\ncommotion long before she spotted anyone. With a swipe of her second electronic\\nkey, she punched in another security code and waited for the small click.\\nStraining, she pushed open the door. Instead of the usual quiet, the place was\\nin chaos.\\n\\nPeople she\\ndidn’t know were running from one place to another. Like chickens with their heads cut off.\\n\\n“Jesus Christ,\\nmake sure those oxygen tanks are working properly. Bunch of dimwits!” screamed\\nCaskett, to a group of young men cowering under his gaze.\\n\\n“Shit! Shit!\\nShit! Why can’t things go right, just once?” he screamed again. This time the\\nverbal attack was aimed at Trevor, who had the nerve to blush when he spotted\\nher.\\n\\n“Thanks for the\\nsleep-in tip, Trevor,” said Jamie sarcastically, trying to back out the door\\nshe’d just sauntered in through.\\n\\n“Oh no, you\\ndon’t. I need you. Come here, Jamie!” screamed Caskett, brushing Trevor off\\nwith a disgusted look on his face and a wave of his hand.\\n\\nThat should have\\nmade her feel better but it didn’t.\\n\\nIn the short\\ntime she’d been working for Caskett, she had learned to despise him. She knew\\nhe had hired her more for her looks than her research, and she hated his habit\\nof reading over her shoulder as she typed in her findings. She had tried numerous\\ntimes to make it plain as day to him she wasn’t one bit interested in him, and\\nwould never in this lifetime sleep with him. No, she knew Caskett’s reputation\\nfor tarnishing interns, as he jokingly referred to others who had held her\\nillustrious position as student-in-residence.\\n\\nRealizing she\\nhadn’t responded, Jamie looked up to catch Caskett staring at her.\\n\\nGreat, of all days to be caught wearing shorts and a\\ntank top.\\nSilently, she made a mental note to keep a stash of extra clothing in her car.\\nHer plan to go into the office early to get some work done in quiet before any\\nof the weekend crew arrived was now out the window. Still wearing her jogging\\ngear didn’t help.\\n\\n“Nice of you to\\njoin us on this luscious Saturday morning, my dear. Do come in. I have a\\nsurprise for you,” said Caskett.\\n\\nHer skin crawled\\nas she caught Caskett’s eyes following her every movement. At six foot one,\\nwith long athletic legs and a slim waist, she usually went out of her way to\\nlook demure. This morning she hadn’t even bothered putting her long black hair\\ninto its usual no-nonsense ponytail.\\n\\nWalking forward\\nto where Caskett was standing, she was very conscious of her waist-length curly\\nhair moving of its own accord. Reaching into her pocket, she thanked herself\\nfor having put extra elastic bands from the file folders she had been reading\\nat one in the morning in her pocket. Slipping the elastic into her hand, she\\ndeftly grabbed her hair and had it tied into a tight ponytail just as she\\nreached Caskett. She could tell by his face he wasn’t one bit pleased.\\n\\nGo to hell. She bravely asked, “What’s up?”\\n\\n“Um, not as much\\nas I’d like,” he whispered, standing on his toes to be eye-level with Jamie.\\n\\nHeight has its advantages. She enjoyed\\nseeing him squirm for a change.\\n\\n“Caught a beauty\\nthis time. A real keeper. Come and see,” said her boss as he tried without\\nsuccess to steer her by the arm to another door—his private, do not enter door.\\n\\n“What do you\\nmean?” she asked, biting her lip nervously. She wasn’t sure she wanted access\\nto the off-limit room. Across the room she noted Trevor’s evil glare as he\\nstared at her in awe, as did a few other of the weekend scientists.\\n\\nIf Caskett let\\nher in this room that would be a first. She’d be the first scientist since the\\nlab had opened a couple of months ago to be granted access. Why her stomach was\\nchurning, she put down to nerves. It made her angry that Trevor’s heated gaze\\nwas a promise of retribution but she deserved this after his lie telling her\\nCaskett wouldn’t be in today.\\n\\nSo she did what\\nshe always did when faced with a challenge. She squared her shoulders and\\nfollowed Caskett.\\n\\n“Are you going\\nto show me those shells now?”\\n\\nInstantly,\\nCaskett stopped. The shells had been a sore topic of conversation ever since\\nshe’d found out about them. No one from the institute had seen them and almost\\neveryone wanted an up close personal peek.\\n\\n“Don’t ask me\\nagain about those shells. They’re gone,” he said, almost grabbing her arms.\\n\\nA quick movement\\nto the left enabled her to avoid his touch. “So what is it? Did you catch\\nsomething?”\\n\\n“You bet. A\\nbottlenose dolphin. She’s charming. She’s got some sort of tattoo or something\\non her dorsal fin, and she’s gone into shock, so I’m hoping you might take a\\nlook at her first. I’m also arranging for a marine specialist to come and look\\nat her. There’s something very unusual about this dolphin, Jamie, and I want\\nyou as my witness to help verify my findings,” he said.\\n\\nThe look of\\ndisbelief on her face said it all. “Look, I’m not really qualified…my research\\nis on…”\\n\\nCaskett turned\\nto look at her. She watched as his eyes narrowed. “I know all about your\\nresearch, don’t forget I hired you. I also know that you’re the only one I have\\non staff that’s studied dolphins extensively, so you are going to help me. Am I\\nclear?”\\n\\nClear as mud, she wanted to say. Instead she meekly\\nnodded.\\n\\nAs he resumed\\nhis walk to his private door, he continued talking. It took all of Jamie’s\\nconcentration to follow his line of reasoning.\\n\\n“When the\\nspecialist gets here, I want you to ask him to take pictures to document that\\ntattoo. I also want you to ask if he’s seen anything like it before. My bet is\\nhe hasn’t. Then in the morning we’ll start the dissection process…”\\n\\nThat stopped her\\ncold. “You mean to kill the dolphin…”\\n\\n“I mean to find\\nthe truth no matter what,” stated Caskett, as he punched in his security code\\nto open his private chambers.\\n\\nThere was an\\naudible creak as the large steel door slowly opened. Inside the concrete room\\nJamie’s sensitive nose caught the rank odor of rotting seaweed and chlorine.\\nShe fought the urge to gag.\\n\\n“Oh my god!” she\\nsaid, her eyes adjusting to the dim light in the room.\\n\\nDirectly across\\nfrom her in a large, but not nearly vast enough circular tank was a small\\nbottlenose dolphin. The dolphin barely had room to complete a full turn. With a\\nquick glance she knew it was sick, as if its life force was being sucked out of\\nit.\\n\\n“I said she was\\na beauty. Now come here. Take a look at that,” said Caskett, willing her to\\nmarch up the steel ladder with him.\\n\\nTowering over\\nthe dolphin, she looked at what he was pointing at. It looks like a tattoo, but that’s ridiculous.\\n\\n“Dolphins don’t\\nhave tattoos. It’s probably a birthmark or an old wound that didn’t heal\\nproperly,” muttered Jamie.\\n\\n“It’s a goddamn\\ntattoo. I want to know why and how it got there! You got that? I want real\\nanswers. Can I count on you, Jamie?” asked Caskett, marching down the ladder.\\n\\nShe knew she\\nnodded, but for the life of her she couldn’t pry her eyes away from the\\nsick-looking dolphin. Her gut clenched with an unfamiliar feeling. She didn’t\\nrealize Caskett had left until the door clicked shut, breaking into her\\nthoughts. Still clutching the ladder’s handrail, she leaned over the aquarium.\\nHer heart was beating irregularly and try as she might, she wasn’t one bit\\nhappy to see the wild, beautiful creature caged. It unnerved her.\\n\\nBut isn’t this my dream? The chance to study a real,\\nwild dolphin up close and personal. Gulping, she took another glance over\\nthe edge. That’s definitely a tattoo.\\nDangling precariously over the tank’s edge she realized what she felt for the\\ndolphin—sorrow. The intensity of the\\nemotion washed over her, causing her to tremble.\\n\\nHelp me.\\n\\nThe words\\nflashed hard and intensely inside her head, causing her to almost let go of the\\nrailing. Sucking in a deep breath, she tried to gather her senses. She took a\\ncalming breath, and slowly backed down the ladder. The uneasy feeling in her\\nstomach didn’t lessen even when her feet were firmly planted on the concrete\\nfloor.\\n\\nTaking another\\ndeep breath, she tried to get a hold of her emotions. Shaking her head, she\\nrealized how foolish she was being.\\n\\nHelp me, please.\\n\\nJamie almost wet\\nher shorts. There was no way she could mistake that. A “help me” could be a\\nfigment of her imagination, but not a “please”.\\n\\n“Wha…wh…” She couldn’t\\nmake her tongue form the words, as she sputtered nonsense.\\n\\nPlease, help me. I’m dying.\\n\\nShe hadn’t even\\nrealized she had moved until her legs backed up hard against the steel door.\\nPanic was seizing her heart, making it impossible for her to take a breath.\\n\\n“Jesus, Jamie.\\nGet your cute behind in here now. I need you to analyze this!” came the\\nscreaming voice of Caskett from behind the closed door.\\n\\nJamie was only\\ntoo happy to oblige. Work. The best thing\\nto get my mind off what most definitely did not happen in there. She yanked\\nthe door open and took one last look at the creature as it turned in the water.\\n\\nlove any type of paranormal, scifi, futuristic, and romantic suspense.

       " 'Effect of DA-8031, a novel oral compound for premature ejaculation, on male rat sexual behavior.\\nDA-8031 is a potent and selective serotonin transporter inhibitor developed for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of DA-8031 on male sexual behavior in a rat model. Sexual behavior was examined after an acute oral administration of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg of DA-8031 in copulation studies with female rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after oral administration of DA-8031 at a dose level of 30 mg/kg. DA-8031 treatment produced a dose-dependent increase in ejaculation latency time and showed statistical significance at 30 and 100 mg/kg dosage levels compared with the vehicle (P < 0.05). In addition, DA-8031 treatment reduced the mean number of ejaculations in a dose-dependent manner. No changes in post-ejaculatory interval, numbers of mounts, intromissions or ejaculations were observed at any dose. In pharmacokinetic study, the blood concentration of DA-8031 peaked at 0.38 ± 0.14 h after oral administration, and then rapidly declined with a half-life of 1.79 ± 0.32 h. Treatment with DA-8031 delays the ejaculation latency time without affecting the initiation of mounting behavior or post-ejaculatory interval in rats. Furthermore, DA-8031 is rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration in rats. These preclinical findings provide a clue for the clinical testing of DA-8031 as an \"on-demand\" agent for premature ejaculation.',\n",

       " 'Defence barrister Tim Marsh has a philosophical bent. A plea hearing is not a search for truth, he told the Victorian supreme court, but it is a search for an explanation. It was his task to explain why Codey Herrmann, aged 20, with no prior convictions and no history of violence, would viciously bash a young woman with a metal pipe, rape and murder her, and set her body on fire.\\n\\n“I think it’s important for me to concede at the start that I will ultimately fall short in this task,” Marsh conceded to Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth at the hearing’s opening last Tuesday. “There is not an explanation I can give you that is going to get us from that start to that finish.”\\n\\nHerrmann, now 21, pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, a 21-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel, in the early hours of 16 January. Maasarwe was studying English at La Trobe university, and in the hours before her death was living her life: attending a comedy show with friends before travelling home by tram.\\n\\nThere is not an explanation I can give you Defence barrister Tim Marsh\\n\\nAs far as we know, Maasarwe said only four words to Herrmann, in Arabic. “You piece of shit,” she screamed, as he came up behind her just after she got off the tram at Bundoora, a suburb in Melbourne’s north. It was a few minutes after midnight. Herrmann bashed her over the head four times with a metal pipe, before dragging her behind nearby hedges, striking her again perhaps nine times and raping her. She was unconscious for most of the attack, and probably dead when he set her body on fire. Herrmann has admitted that he intended to kill her.\\n\\nIn a legal sense, the purpose of a plea hearing is for the prosecutor and the defence to argue factors relevant to the sentence that should be imposed, including mitigating factors that made the crime less serious than others, and aggravating factors that made it worse. There was no dispute that Herrmann’s crime was exceptionally horrific and he will spend decades in prison.\\n\\nThe three days of hearings were about whether someone who could commit such an unprovoked crime should spend the rest of his life in jail, with the possibility of parole at a distant time, or be handed a defined sentence, perhaps 30 years or so.\\n\\nHollingworth acknowledged that hers was an “invidious task” to grade crimes as more or less serious, because it could seem insensitive to the family and the community, “but that is unfortunately what the law requires us to do”, she said.\\n\\nBehind the legal arguments was the deeper story, the one that defied explanation. Herrmann, a slight man wearing a tracksuit top, sat at the back of the court. Through days of intense argument about who he was, what Marsh called his “extraordinary dislocation and disadvantage”, his humiliations, his substance abuse, his mental state, it was sometimes hard to remember he was there. His eyes were mostly downcast or staring into the distance. Occasionally he stroked his chin, or bit his lip. He seemed to be in his own world.\\n\\nCodey Herrmann is brought to the supreme court. Photograph: James Ross/AAP\\n\\nMaasarwe’s family was not present in court – they live overseas – but their pain was there. Her death became a symbol of women’s rage at being unable to go out at night without fear of male violence, but the picture that emerged of her was of an individual, a young, vibrant daughter, sister and friend who loved travel and study, spoke four languages, a woman who lost her life in a few minutes of inexplicable horror.\\n\\nThe plain-speaking prosecutor, Patrick Bourke, paused for several seconds, his bottom lip quivering, as he read out the family’s victim statements. Maasarwe’s mother, Kittam, still watches videos and reads her daughter’s text messages, just to see her and hear her voice. “‘I am a mother whom her heart has been squeezed in pain, day after day.”\\n\\nHer father, Saeed, and sister, Noor, planned to visit Aiia in Australia. “A lot of time I find myself lost, lost in the crowds, or sometimes stuck, stuck in the past. Now I live with fear,” Noor wrote.\\n\\nAfter Maasarwe hopped off the tram to walk the rest of the way home, she rang another sister, Ruba, in Israel. She often did that when she was alone at night, just to feel safer. The call was answered, and Aiia said to Ruba, “I didn’t expect you to pick up”.\\n\\nSeconds later, Hermann hit her from behind with the metal pipe, before dragging her away from sight into a garden bed behind low hedges. Ruba heard the phone drop and her sister screaming.\\n\\nThe order of what happened next is not clear, but the prosecution says Herrmann strangled Maasarwe, bashed her a further nine times, and raped her. She died of extensive head injuries. In a futile attempt to cover up his crime, he poured the flammable solvent WD-40 over her, and set her alight.\\n\\nFor several hours before the attack, Herrmann had wandered around the nearby Polaris shopping centre, his image caught on CCTV. He spoke to a man and smoked a cigarette. He has given no explanation about what he was doing or thinking. He claims he doesn’t know how he found the metal pipe or the WD-40 – they are not visible in CCTV footage. He has said he didn’t plan the murder. Afterwards, he fled the scene, climbing over a fence into a nature reserve, leaving a trail of his DNA on his cap, the pipe, the can of fluid and on Maasarwe’s body.\\n\\n‘I’ve seen fathers portrayed in movies’\\n\\nThere’s the crime itself and then there’s what led up to it. The forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Carroll interviewed Herrmann in custody and had access to more than 2,000 pages of material from the Victorian Aboriginal Childcare Association, which has had contact with Herrmann since he was a baby. His mother was an Indigenous woman; his father was of German ancestry.\\n\\nThere were multiple reports to authorities when Herrmann was a small child, Marsh said, “due to chronic drug and alcohol problems with his parents, domestic violence, emotional abuse and what was described perhaps euphemistically as, ‘failure to meet his basic needs’. This level of neglect was so profound that he and his older sister were reported to have rotten teeth.”\\n\\nAt less than 18 months old, Herrmann was placed in care and admitted to hospital with scabies. At age three, he and his sister were placed in foster care.\\n\\nCarroll explained the profound psychological impact of his early neglect and how it stunted his brain development. He traced his later distress at his mother failing to turn up to access visits, or arriving drunk. He had no contact with his father while he was in foster care. “He was reared in a chaotic, insecure, dangerous environment that was not responsive to his basic needs.”\\n\\nThis is the manifestation of male rage towards a female Psychiatrist Andrew Carroll\\n\\nHerrmann has had no positive relationship with men, including his father. At one point, Carroll asked Herrmann about fathers and he said: “I’ve seen them portrayed in the movies, but I don’t really know what they do.” His mother died when he was a teenager.\\n\\nEven though his foster care was more stable, the early-childhood needs are critical for a child to develop any normal sense of attachment and trust in the world. By the time Herrmann entered primary school he was emotionally fragile, had difficulty forming relationships and harmed other children.\\n\\nCarroll’s evidence was that Herrmann had a severe personality disorder with particular characteristics. His childhood neglect meant he avoided and suppressed his emotional distress. His unresolved trauma led to a “deep well-spring of sadness and anger” that he had no skills to process. He had distorted assumptions about other people, with “persistent expectations of being exploited, humiliated and belittled” – in middle childhood he had nightmares and slept in a foetal position. Normal functioning was seriously impaired and there was “a sense almost of dissociation, a sense that he just doesn’t matter in the world, that he’s not real in some way”.\\n\\nThere was a “matrix of factors” which led to this crime and Herrmann’s personality disorder – a person’s deficits in thinking, feeling and behaviour, particularly in relation to impulse control and interpersonal behaviour – was exacerbated by heavy cannabis and methamphetamine use that began when he was a teenager. That had a cumulative impact, but he had not taken drugs on the day of the murder.\\n\\nAs a young adult, Herrmann was homeless and unemployed. According to Marsh, Herrmann’s life “followed a rhythm that was essentially, get Centrelink, buy drugs, share them with mates, shoplift food from the supermarket. He subsisted on a diet of croissants and chocolate milk … his lifestyle was one of the pursuit of intoxication through methamphetamine and cannabis.”\\n\\nCarroll’s evidence was that Herrmann’s personality disorder seriously affected his ability to make judgments and was, with other factors, the underlying reason for the murder. It was an “eruption of suppressed rage” that had built for years. It erupted for some unknown reason on that night, against an innocent woman, with no known trigger. “This is the manifestation of male rage towards a female.”\\n\\nThe reason so long was spent on describing’s Herrmann’s personality disorder is that he has for many years been diagnosed as suffering schizophrenia, and is receiving anti-psychotic meditation.\\n\\nCarroll disagreed with that diagnosis, but legally a personality disorder is not considered a mental impairment that can be taken into consideration when sentencing in Victoria, under principles known as Verdins.\\n\\nMarsh, chief counsel at Victoria Legal Aid, argued that a 2015 case – a court of appeal decision known as O’Neill – was wrong to find that such disorders do not influence a sufferer’s perception of the world, and urged Hollingworth to find so. There was no reason why personality disorders – which could seriously affect judgment – should be treated differently to mental illnesses that influence the moral culpability of an offender, such as severe depression or bipolar disorder.\\n\\nBourke argued that the very randomness, the brutality, the lack of any motive made this the worst kind of murder justifying a life sentence. The O’Neill decision was correct and Hollingworth sitting as a single judge was bound to follow it. There was “no evidence of the present personality disorder having a causative connection, contribution to the commission of this offence against this girl on this night”.\\n\\nIf a trial is in some way an expression of community feeling and shifting attitudes, perhaps we are at a point where such crimes will be punished by 50 or 60 years in jail, even if they did not attract such severe sentences in the past.\\n\\nBetter off in jail than outside\\n\\nIt was the same issue that confronted the court just a few weeks ago when Jaymes Todd, another young man with no prior convictions, was sentenced to life with a 35-year non-parole period for raping and murdering Eurydice Dixon, 22, as she walked through a suburban Melbourne park.\\n\\nThat was a controversial sentence in legal circles. Victoria Legal Aid funded Todd’s plea hearing, but is not funding his appeal against the sentence – that will be conducted by private barristers pro bono.\\n\\nIn Todd’s case crown prosecutors did not seek a life sentence, but they did in Herrmann’s case. Hollingworth wondered why, when Todd’s was “objectively far more serious offending” given his sexual sadism and stalking of Dixon.\\n\\nHerrmann is Aboriginal which, as Marsh pointed out, does not make him intrinsically less responsible for his crime and deserving of a more lenient sentence. But it often indicates deprivation and disadvantage, and his background of profound trauma, the instability of his identity and sense of futility could be seen as a mitigating factor in sentencing.\\n\\nMarsh said Herrmann’s youth indicated rehabilitation was at least possible if the right treatment was offered. His sense of remorse was there, but it was muted. At the very end of the hearing, Herrmann handed Marsh a letter of apology he had written to Maasarwe’s family. “Your daughter didn’t deserve such a terrible and tragic thing to happen to her,” it said. “I don’t expect any forgiveness because I will never be able to forgive myself and I will be trying to make amends for the rest of my life.” It ended: “Don’t give in to hate like I did. Love. Goodbye.”\\n\\nMarsh said towards the end of the hearing that while it didn’t diminish the loss of the Maasarwe family in any way, there was a second tragedy in the case we should not flinch from: how and why a young man could come to commit such an awful crime.\\n\\nHerrmann believed he was better off in jail than outside.\\n\\n“I’ve gained a safe place to sleep,” Marsh said Herrmann told him. “I get fed three times a day, I have a shower, and I’ve also gained a sense of hope that maybe one day if I behave myself in custody I might get to go to a prison that has good programs.”\\n\\nThat such a statement had a whiff of truth to it, said Marsh, was “coming from a place that is so bleak as to defy description”.\\n\\nCodey Herrmann will be sentenced on 29 October.',\n",

While she got Gelf\\'s URL wrong in her pitch (sadly, Gelf.com is still the domain of an Apache-powered web server enthusiast), she was spot-on in her assessment that we were interested in panda porn.

There are still a bunch of references to the BBC, sellotape, and the like.\\n\\nDS: I wanted to, but because of the stupid schedules publishing seems to work to, there wasn’t really a chance. But obviously any jokes you didn’t get or thought fell a bit flat, would have seemed brilliant if you’d grown up in the UK. Even the Mormon Cricket Sir-Clicks-A-Lot gag. Oh yes.\\n\\nGM: You told the guy from the Cleveland Plain Dealer that you use a pen name so that your family doesn’t find out you wrote a book about animal sex. But isn’t the book published under your real name in the UK?\\n\\nGM: In the same interview, you mention that you had an interest in primatology at university. (Me too, actually.) You have any good anecdotes about monkey sex from your time there?\\n\\nDS: Disappointingly it wasn’t very hands-on, unless you were prepared to go and knock about in Uganda for half a year, so I’m afraid I haven’t really. But a friend of mine just got back from working at a chimpanzee sanctuary in West Africa, where one of the younger chimps got quite attached to her. Only when he realised that he wasn’t going to get anywhere, he got in a mood, did a wee in the kitchen and, via sign-language, tried to make out to the other primatologists that it was my friend who was responsible. Never spurn those chimps.\\n\\nGM: When I used to study macaques, I seem to remember them using the same magic-shell genital plug trick that you described in rats (i.e. the male\\'s semen hardens inside the vagina to prevent other males from copulating), plus there was a lot of masturbation by disappointed males. Point is, you must have had to leave out some good stuff from your research. Anything get cut from the book that you were hoping would make it? Is there enough for a sequel?\\n\\nDS: Well, because I wasn’t exactly trying to be encyclopaedic, and lots of creatures use similar strategies, it was mostly a case of picking whichever creature best illustrated whatever they happened to be getting up to. Given that there\\'s two million animals out there we already know about, and at least another eight million or so we reckon are still to be discovered, I\\'m sure there\\'s enough for a sequel, but I think I\\'ve probably spent enough time trying to find obscure articles about moth mites having sex with their sisters to last me a while.\\n\\nGM: Which animals’ sex lives were the hardest to write about for a lay audience?\\n\\nDS: In terms of the science, that wasn\\'t an issue to be honest, because a spot of primatology at university as part of an anthropology degree doesn’t make me an expert, so I’m a lay audience myself. The hardest ones to do were the animals who leant themselves to the most obvious jokes. I didn’t want to just write a leering “Phew, girls, I bet you wish your man could manage it a hundred and fifty times a night!” effort, which is what most \"humourous\" takes on the subject seem to lapse into. Not that I\\'m saying I resisted all the cheap laughs.\\n\\nGM: In your page on panda porn, you make a smart comment about the seemingly random series of evolutionary events that have given pandas giant heads and thus made them extremely cute to humans. Any general thoughts on people’s fascination with charismatic megafauna?\\n\\nDS: I like charismatic megafauna as much as the next man, so I don’t think you can really blame people for singling them out over other species when it comes to being bothered about the environment. Of course, you don\\'t want to go down the Timothy Treadwell route, because it doesn\\'t matter how damn charismatic they are, they can still swipe your face off without breaking a sweat.\\n\\nCourtesy K. McCracken\\n\\nNot bad.\\n\\nGM: The Argentine Lake Duck. Does that thing just hang in the water?\\n\\nDS: No, usually it’s fully retracted inside them. I’m still not sure I believe it. If that paper [PDF] wasn’t written by a respected group of scientists, I think I’d assume they’d just got it muddled with an intestine or something. I really want to see some footage of the males using it to lasso the females, which I also have a hard time believing.\\n\\nGM: What sort of a person would want to buy this book?\\n\\nDS: Oh dear, I have no idea whatsoever. People who have just remembered it\\'s their uncle\\'s birthday and have half an hour to find a present? And hopefully anyone who is interested in the natural world but doesn’t have a hang-up about it not being taken very seriously. I think there’s a bit of a tradition of having to take the sombre \"nature in all her majesty\" approach when it comes to writing about these kind of things, and you get a bit frowned at if you’re seen laughing at it all. But dolphins trying to get lucky with turtles is funny, and there’s no getting around that.\\n\\nGM: You write that banana slugs engage in chewing each others penises off, or appophalation. Shouldn’t that be apophallation? Also, maybe we\\'re being picky, but isn’t the banana slug\\'s scientific name Ariolimax dolich-o-phallus and not Ariolimax dolich-y-phallus?\\n\\nDS: Fuck. Yes. You’re right. Apo- as in detach, phallus as in penis. In my defence, I first read up on banana-slug sex in Adrian Forsyth’s excellent A Natural History of Sex, and he spells it wrong too, so even proper scientists can screw up. And I\\'ll put the other down to a typo. Anyhow, I hope you’re pointing this out to show off how much Latin you know, because otherwise it\\'s just odd to know that off the top of your head.\\n\\nGM: Have you heard back from any of the scientists whose research you used in the course of writing the book? If so, what did they have to say?\\n\\nDS: I think they’re much too busy dipping bed-bugs into big buckets of radiation to read daft things like this.\\n\\nGM: Have you gotten any other feedback?\\n\\nDS: I got a letter the other day from some old guy in New Zealand. It’s a bit hard to read, but I think the gist of the thing is that I should have only included entries on snakes. He seems to really like snakes. And the book seems worryingly popular with little kids who clearly aren\\'t subject to enough parental control.\\n\\nGM: In some of the promo materials going around the web for the book, the phrase turkey virgin birth is used. I didn’t see that in the book. Can you explain?\\n\\nDS: That was something I came across quite early in researching the book. In a few turkey populations I think \"virgin births\" have been observed to run at a surprisingly high rate, like 40% or something. But it’s like I said about a lot of creatures illustrating the same point, so I went with the pseudocopulating all-female whiptail lizards instead.\\n\\nGM: What’s up with the randomly bold-typed phrases in the book?\\n\\nDS: It’s a code. You take the first letter of each bold sentence and it tells you where Leonardo Da Vinci buried the Holy Grail! And also, if you’re going to write a book that includes the phrases “injecting their sperm into the abdomens of other males,” “he laps up her urine,” and “detachable swimming penises,” then you might as well use them to get people’s attention.\\n\\nDS: Yes, there’s about a million of them, all the way from Aristotle to Wendt’s compendious 1965 The Sex Life of the Animals to Forsyth’s book and so on. I avoided Dr Tatiana at the time of writing, because I was worried it might be too similar in tone, but actually it’s a really good proper in-depth study underneath the agony aunt gimmick. They did a TV show of it recently, but I was kind of disappointed, because there was a bit too much people singing and dancing about, and not enough proper footage of creatures.\\n\\nDS: Does that mean my book’s for sale in Urban Outfitters? Brilliant. I didn’t know that! Well, I’m sure Urban Outfitters buy their books only after a serious consideration of the contribution each work makes to the world of literature. And not because having “sex” in the title and a picture of some cute pandas on the cover means they think it will appeal to some spurious hipster demographic.\\n\\nGM: Is there an index of items your dog did successfully have sex with?',\n",

The process that resulted in Turkey’s becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world. You don’t need deep knowledge to know that. You have to be a real idiot to do that.”\\n\\nTens of thousands of Turks have taken to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara to protest against their government’s provocations which have taken Turkey to the brink of war with Syria. And while the Turkish army continues to shell Syrian positions across the border the Syrian government has again called on Turkey to stop helping the rebels who use Turkey as a safe haven for their terrorist attacks.\\n\\nAnti-war protests are spreading across Turkey following border clashes near Aleppo which have continued all week. The Islamist Turkish government, which openly supports the Syrian rebels, claims it is responding to Syrian army shelling that killed five Turks in the town of Akcakale last week. But local Turks blame their own government for allowing the town to be used as an infiltration route by the Nato-backed Syrian rebels and the Damascus media claim that the incident was a provocation by the rebels themselves to provide a pretext for open Turkish military support for the “Free Syrian Army”.\\n\\nTurkish demonstrators, many carrying “No to War!” and “Hands off Syria” banners, are reflecting a growing fear throughout the country that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government is playing with fire. The protests have been backed by the communists and the social democratic Republican People’s Party whose virtual dominance of Turkish political life was ended when the AKP won the 2002 elections on a Muslim Brotherhood platform. Republican People’s Party leader Kemal Kiliçdaroglu, the leader of the opposition in the Turkish parliament, said he was against the shedding of Turkish soldiers’ blood in Arabian deserts and he called Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu an “idiot” for pursuing a policy that was isolating Turkey.\\n\\nKiliçdaroglu said that Turkey could only count on the support of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government and Hamas, the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood that controls the Gaza Strip, while Iran, Russia, China, Brazil and India oppose Turkey’s foreign policy on Syria.\\n\\n“How can we describe the policy that put Turkey into this situation?

The process that resulted in Turkey’s becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world. You don’t need deep knowledge to know that. You have to be a real idiot to do that,” Kiliçdaroglu said.\\n\\nThough the AKP steamrollered a motion through the Turkish parliament authorising “necessary military action” across the border a survey by the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet (Liberty) concluded that 60 per cent of the public were opposed the parliamentary bill.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Damascus, progressive forces in the Syrian parliament have called for national unity in the face of the international conspiracy targeting their country.

       " 'In Forgotten Patriots, author Edwin G Burrows rights an awful wrong. The patriot prisoners who risked death rather than abandon their honor and their country, suffered horribly, but their sacrifices have gone largely unnoticed because it has not been politically expedient to reveal their treatment at the hands of the British.\\n\\nReaders of this book should expect to be surprised. Although the cover promises “The untold story of American Prisoners during the Revolutionary War,” the author delivers much more. In rescuing these men from the oblivion to which historians, for a variety of reasons and circumstances, consigned them, Burrows reveals a great deal about our national beginnings and the people and events that shaped America.\\n\\nAnd while he also reveals the avarice, cruelty, political chicanery, stupidity and arrogance, which are so often the companions of power, he represents honor, courage, decency and sacrifice as well.\\n\\nIndividuals who played major and minor roles in this compelling story include Ethan Allen, Benjamin Franklin and Tory son William; the disgraced and duplicitous General Charles Lee, (whom George Washington once called “a damn poltroon”); the unfortunate Judge Richard Stockton, the only signer of the Declaration of Independence to be taken captive; David Sproat, commissary of naval prisoners known for his indifference to the suffering of prisoners in his charge; and many others whose valor or perfidy have hitherto been unremarked.\\n\\nBurrrows writes with the objectivity of the historian he is, but only a dull reader will miss the author’s passion for the forgotten patriots his words have exhumed from the mass graves in which they have been buried for over 200 years.\\n\\nAn estimated 200,000 Americans went to war against the British crown. Of these 6,824 died in combat and another 10,000 succumbed to wounds or disease in camp. Burrows writes that of the 23,850 to 32,000 Americans interned in and around Manhattan, the total who perished, including 11,000 believed to have died on British prison ships, ranged from 15,575 to 18,000 men; in other words, between two and three times the number killed in battle, and 50% more than those who died in camp. Burrow’s book is the first account of what took place in British prisons.\\n\\nHe begins with the Battle of Brooklyn on August 27, 1776, the biggest battle of the Revolutionary War and one that dealt the Continental Army a potentially fatal blow. Hugely outnumbered, ill trained and poorly equipped, the colonials were, in the words of one British officer, dispatched with bayonets “after we had surrounded them so they could not resist.”\\n\\nThose who survived surrender presented a logistical problem for General Howe, commander of the British force. To deal with the problem, Howe appointed a Boston Tory named Joshua Loring as his commissary general of military prisoners. Burrows writes, Loring “possessed two unbeatable qualifications for the job: a settled conviction that men who took arms against their sovereign deserved no mercy, and a beautiful wife, to whom the general had taken a fancy (Loring ‘fingered the cash,’ quipped the Tory historian Thomas Jones, while the General enjoyed the madam).’”1\\n\\nThe prisoners were, according to established British practice, held in vessels of the invasion fleet until the British gained possession of New York City and located quarters in which to confine them. However, New York was a ruined city and didn’t offer many options. Few residents remained among the shattered buildings, but there were throngs of Tory refugees seeking British protection; runaway slaves in search of safe haven; and a British force of more than 33,000 men plus their American captives whose numbers increased with each battle. Provisioning was an on-going problem. Either due to shortages or because the jailors sold their food, the prisoners received meager rations of the poorest quality. Some later credited their survival to the kindness of a few city residents who shared what little food they had.\\n\\nThe buildings in which the men were kept, Liberty House, Provost Jail, Sugar House and various commandeered Protestant (never Anglican) Churches, became infamous for brutal overcrowding, lack of sanitation, rampant disease, and starved prisoners. The Provost jail, where high-ranking officers and civilians accused of supporting the rebellion were kept, was known for the deliberate brutality of Provost Marshal Captain William Cunningham.\\n\\nBeyond the sadism of men like Cunningham, there were other forces that determined prisoners’ treatment. Burrows writes, “My reading of the evidence is that the thousands of Americans who perished in New York during the Revolution were the victims of something well beyond the usual brutalities and misfortunes of war, even eighteenth century war—a lethal convergence, as it were, of obstinacy, condescension, corruption, mendacity, and indifference.”\\n\\nAlthough European wars produced some humane precepts and customs regarding prisoners, none of these were yet codified in treaties or conventions. Enforcement of unwritten guidelines was uneven at best and whether these guidelines even applied in cases of domestic insurrection or rebellion was an open question.\\n\\n“The thousand-odd Americans who surrendered during the Battle of Brooklyn thus faced a future fraught with unusual peril. Unprotected by international agreements or by the code of honor that regulated the conduct of officers and gentlemen, they were at the complete mercy of their enraged captors. As Captain MacKenzie of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers wrote soon after the battle, captured Americans should not really be considered prisoners of war at all. They were nonpersons, to be used in any way that would most effectively put an end to the resurrection.”\\n\\nThere was a social chasm between British officers and those of the Continental Army. British officers were wealthy gentlemen from leading families who subscribed to a code of honor in dealing with equals. The shopkeeper and farmer officers of the Continental Army were deemed unworthy of being treated as gentlemen. To make matters worse, although Americans believed they were defending their traditional rights as Englishmen, the perception on the other side of the Atlantic was very different. Captured Americans were not viewed as enemy combatants, but as rebels guilty of sedition and treason.\\n\\nColonial defiance came at a time when the Empire was shaken by turbulence in Scotland and Ireland. Thus the King and many in Parliament saw the American insurrection as a threat to national unity and stability. Doctor Samuel Johnson epitomized this view, calling the Americans “a race of convicts” that “ought to be thankful for anything we allow them short of hanging.”\\n\\nIt should not surprise that officers of his Majesty’s armed forces in America reflected these attitudes. Washington’s many letters of complaint to General Howe regarding the treatment of American prisoners were either ignored or dismissed with false denials.\\n\\nAs the war progressed and it became impossible to cram more prisoners into already overcrowded buildings, they were confined in troop transports anchored in Wallabout Bay, now known only as the site of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard. The author describes a shipboard hell where men were confined below decks in conditions so crowded that they could not lie down at the same time, packed so tightly that some suffocated. They subsisted on rations barely sufficient to sustain life and breathed air so putrid that men fought for space at the deck grates. Nor were things any easier for the thousands locked up on land. Wormy food, putrid water, random floggings and so much sickness that burial parties would remove ten or twenty bodies each morning.\\n\\nThe terrible treatment of American prisoners weighed on George Washington. Burrows reveals that he threatened to retaliate in kind against British captives, but never carried out the threat. Rather, he was determined that enemy prisoners be treated humanly and, with few exceptions, they were.\\n\\nReaders will learn that while George Washington was fighting the Redcoats, he was also at war with Congress over, among other things, the absence of a formal agreement for the regular exchange of prisoners, an established practice among combatants.\\n\\nAmerican newspapers printed hundreds of letters, affidavits and other accounts testifying to the horrific conditions of the American prisoners. Washington’s complaints to General Howe elicited continued denials of what had become common knowledge. Washington badgered Congress to appoint a commissary general for prisoners to supply food, clothing and other essentials to American prisoners and to care for enemy captives. In 1777 Congress complied. The author describes the valiant efforts of commissaries Lewis Pintard and Elias Boudinot to obtain supplies for American prisoners. When Boudinot discovered that Congress had no money to spend on the prisoners, he spent his own, putting himself in debt. He could not nearly meet the need, but it was better than nothing at all. Burrows writes, “Washington had said he wanted ‘a shrewd sensible man’ for the job of commissary general. The man he got was a saint.”\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin saw the abuse of American prisoners as irreconcilably severing ties with the mother country. “When the war was over and independence assured, he would look back on the refusal of thousands of ordinary men to abandon the cause while in captivity, even at the cost of their lives, as ‘glorious Testimony in favor of plebian Virtue.’” British military and naval recruiters regularly combed the prisons and prison ships for defectors. It was said that prisoners were treated harshly to make them switch sides. Some did so and some then deserted at the earliest opportunity, returning voluntarily to their own lines with news of enemy troop strength and location. Many more risked death rather than abandon their honor and their country.\\n\\nBurrows is appalled that the sacrifices of these patriots have been forgotten.\\n\\nLocal politics, and the destruction of the prisons to make room for the rapidly growing city made it difficult to remember the horrors that took place in them. However, the most enduring reason was Anglo-American reconciliation.\\n\\n“For moderate and conservative patriots like Alexander Hamilton, the key to rebuilding and recovery was political reconciliation. Everything hinged on recognizing that the Revolution was finished…” Thus the Tories who had fled were welcomed back and their property restored. Their money, connections and know-how were needed to build the new nation.\\n\\nThe passage of time did nothing to diminish that dynamic. The author writes,\\n\\n“In the decades on either side of WWI, the deaths of thousands of captives during the Revolution was downgraded in American public opinion from an outrage to an embarrassment – a regrettable minor breach in the friendship of two kindred peoples. Academic historians, eager to rescue the Revolution from flag-waving jingoism and personality cults, shelved the subject.”\\n\\nForgotten Patriots rights that awful wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But Liberation is the smoothest blend of muscle-car bombast and Kraftwerkian Euro-riddims the band has concocted to date. They worked the bugs out of the formula, it seems. And while I’ll miss how amusingly unpredictable TA could be, I can’t complain about their first long-player that works, front to back.\\n\\nOf course, I’ve always dug Trans Am. Whether or not it’s a function of proximity to Dad’s shameless prog-rock collection during my tender years, or listening to Wax Trax! fests on WNCW’s “ARC Overnight” with my teenaged noodle softened by hormones, drugs and sleep deprivation, I suppose I’ll never know. The Am’s aural leetspeak simultaneously satirizes and functions as a certain cerebral swagger I’ve always enjoyed. On numerous levels. I wouldn’t recommend them to a lot of my friends.\\n\\nBut the band has a healthy school of fans, and until now it’s never resisted fucking with them. For every galvanizing Futureworld or hyperambitious Red Line, we got the frustrating minimalism of The Surveillance or the disposable ‘80s theme party TA.\\n\\nSo it feels good to hear the straight-ahead jock jam drums and wocka-wocking guitar on “Outmoder” – it feels honest. And it’s particularly grand to hear Trans Am navigate –without smirking - the same icy emotional depths as their synth-pop patrons, as they do on “Divine Invasion” and “Music for Dogs.” Hey, I didn’t know they took this shit seriously! The melancholy “Is Trans Am Really Your Friend?” would be exquisite even in a batch of Gary Numan tunes.\\n\\nThey even went so far as to hock the Vocoder, apparently. Only “Music for Dogs” and “Idea Machine” are muddied with the band’s always-execrable vocals, and those are, if breathy nonsense, at least not cute at all.\\n\\nIn their retreat from the post-modern, Trans Am manages more genuine complexity than before. “June,” with it’s chunky beat, snarling core, sobbing lead and eerie, reverbed fade, should be three or four times its length.\\n\\nIf Trans Am continues to mellow, this might be the last of several great albums. But for the impatient, it’s the first really good one.\\n\\nWacky vocal cut-ups are as follows: “Uninvited Guest” (blunt satire-by-recontextualization on G. W. Bush that’s going to sound about as fresh as Fresh Bush and the Invisible Man’s “Hard Times” within a few years, I hope) and “White Rhino” (weather forecast at variable speed).',\n",

       " 'Let’s give credit where it’s due: Eminem’s first album in four years does not contain the lyric “I even make the bitches I rape cum.”\\n\\nBut it does feature “Just escaped from the state pen for raping eight women who hate men.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thing is, Eminem’s most successful heir, Tyler, the Creator, had just reached his 20s when he decided he couldn’t rap things like “rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome” anymore. Just six years later, Tyler, who used to call people “faggot” liberally in his rhymes, particularly his absentee father, is making year-end lists for Flower Boy, an album on which he regularly alludes to a queer lovelife.\\n\\nIt took Eminem until age 45 and album number nine to stop using the word “faggot.” He doesn’t have any invective for his longtime estranged mom on Revival either. He does, however, rap about his ex Kim again, 18 years after he fantasized to the world about dumping her body in a river with his daughter helping on “’97 Bonnie and Clyde” and 17 years after the prequel “Kim” shook the universe in its unflinching, cinematic portrayal of an abusive relationship at its most toxic, changing rap forever. Nearly two decades on, in “Bad Husband”, he apologizes to Kim and confesses to the largest rap audience on planet Earth that he used to punch his daughter’s mother, and used her as an excuse for his own abuse, even going as far as to state “Girls, your dad is a scumbag.”\\n\\nIt should be chilling, gut-wrenching, one of the most powerful moments in a career of many. Instead, like nearly all of his time on the mic during Revival’s lung-collapsing 80 minutes, the words are rushed, stumbled over, shoved awkwardly into an overstuffed verse … kind of like overhead luggage. He doesn’t rest on “scumbag,” shoehorning in the excess ad lib “I’m confused because–” before the outsourced chorus returns. It’s almost like he can’t sit with his own confession for a moment, like he’s not making eye contact as he tells it. The words are still brave, in their way, but what good is it if he botches the delivery?\\n\\nOne reason why Jay Z’s 4:44 was one of the year’s absolute high-watermarks, and a landmark for confessional rap, is because he focuses on an inside voice, appropriately soul-searching production, and making sure every word is consumed with the exact gravity he intends, even the funny ones. His incredulous “…okay” after reprising one of O.J. Simpson’s most infamous quotes (“I’m not black, I’m O.J.”) spoke volumes. To say that Eminem fails tonally on Revival is a grave underestimate; he never sounds right on these 19 songs. He often barks with the same vituperative cadence that he used to kill Kim on record in the first place, which makes sense when he’s taking aim at Trump and far less when he’s cataloguing his failings as a human being. He forces the listener to pay more attention than his thorny constructions now deserve; in other words, you won’t be happier for having squinted through a batch of weeds like “Like a real thin joint it comes on Quilted Northern/ In a built-in toilet/ Bitch, I told you I’m a dog/ I wouldn’t heal with ointment” in Em’s attempt at a Migos/Cardi flow on “Chloraseptic”.\\n\\n“Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?” he asks on Revival’s opener and first single “Walk on Water”, which features Beyoncé singing a generic messianic chorus with all the enthusiasm of an extortion victim. It’s incredible in the worst way that, after she passed Kanye’s mantle of the most vital musician in the world, she still has to duet with Ed Sheeran (presumably just to achieve her first No. 1 hit of the 2010s) or lend credibility to this out-of-touch rageaholic’s redemption narrative. Nevertheless, he did set a high bar. Peak Eminem made music something it had never been before, upping rap’s technical skill ante by dozens while introducing gripping morality plays rendered far more uncomfortably and vividly in their grotesque detail than any gangsta rap record to date (or any country or rock or R&B record either). No, it’s not an exaggeration to place the lifelike mastery of “Stan” or “Kim” on the same wavelength as “A Day in the Life”.\\n\\nHe was also hilarious, more often than you may remember. 2004’s much-lambasted Encore now plays like a gulp of fresh air. Eminem may have been in the throes of an addiction that almost killed him a decade ago, but he effortlessly skipped from rhyme to joke to goofy celebrity impression, as if he was Jim Carrey in The Mask. There isn’t a single laugh on Revival; the closest thing is maybe “I’m so narcissistic/ When I fart, I sniff it,” and his delivery is often arthritic, cumbersome, devoid of spaces to pause and laugh if he were to accidentally cause such a thing. This leaves a song like “Remind Me”, which cuts little pieces out of “I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll” like the redacted portions of a memo so that Eminem can peer through its eyeholes, sounding completely dead in the water as he tries to convince us that he’s a man who appreciates butts. Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” is more appealing than a Joan Jett desecration containing the words: “That booty is heavy duty like diarrhea.”\\n\\nIt must be said that the production here is absolutely awful, that someone this removed from the landscape needs someone more in-tune than Rick Rubin to sample the Cranberries’ “Zombie” artlessly on “In My Head” or lay a bad impression of Ryan Lewis’ piano beneath “Walk on Water”. The guests don’t sound at all like Eminem’s friends or collaborative peers; they sound like called-in favors. If Pink or Beyoncé has a deeper relationship with the artist, their parts certainly don’t show it. Alicia Keys’ quite-pretty chorus on “Like Home” is easily the most sonorous thing on the record, but so what? Eminem’s verses are like a brick through stained glass. The sound of him is so unceasingly ugly at this point that it’s a wonder why all these singers are on hand (yes, Sheeran’s here too) trying to balance him out with sugar. Why not just lean into the hideousness and bring out hard rockers and firebrands? Hardcore vocalists, thick-necked rappers, System of a Down, surely Rubin’s got a Rolodex more imaginative than Skylar Grey to dust off. That said, when he takes this advice, you get a track like “Framed,” where his slow-motion yelling of the title aims for an unholy hybrid of Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, and Pee-Wee Herman, and somehow still falls short.\\n\\nYet even those agitprop moments manage to be inappropriate. The six-minute racial-profiling diatribe “Untouchable” is no epic, just a drowning mess of poorly-landed rhymes like “Here come the swine/ Trying to clean up the streets from all these mi-norities” and a generous helping of Cheech and Chong’s “Earache My Eye” that doesn’t help Mr. Mathers’ schoolyard chanting of “black boy, black boy, we don’t like the sound of you” sound any more cutting and less like something his most misguided fans are likely to repurpose disgustingly. The song’s best points, such as “Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit,” can’t even be called great lyrics, really. They’re just straight readings of facts that he may be nobly reaching some of those misguided fans with. It was good of him to try, but he taints his own intentions so often that you can’t call it successful.\\n\\nHe compares himself to Bill Cosby on “Offended”, completely undermining anything else the song has to level at deserving, should-be easy targets like Mitch McConnell, Kellyanne Conway, or the president. When he references Anna Nicole Smith, who’s been dead for 10 years, to reference her boobs on “Remind Me”, there’s no empathy or parallels, despite the fact that the closing track, “Arose”, is a hypothetical farewell to his kids if he had died from the pill overdose he survived the same year Smith died. (Even the title “Arose” is wretched on paper, a word that’s never isolated and so obviously contorted, that even on the page it reads as a laborious setup, in this case because the tune samples Bette Midler’s “The Rose”, which doesn’t make it any less of a dangling verb.)\\n\\nThe pile of self-thwarted attempts to say something meaningful and jokes either so old they could take a long walk off a short pier (Two consecutive lines in “Need Me”: “I’m swimmin’ in that Egyptian river, ’cause I’m in denial/ Say I don’t eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin’ grin when I smile” – and that’s one of the introspective ones) or so convoluted it’s hard to believe they exist (“I’ll put you in your place like a realtor, boy”), combined with the length of the project, the wait since his last record, the anti-chemistry of the cameos, the indifference of the production, which amounts to poorly mixed karaoke much of the time, makes Revival unquestionably one of the most infuriating and irritating listens of a year when few people want to hear half-assed soliloquies by men.\\n\\nRevival was undoubtedly a huge personal project for Marshall Mathers – most of his albums are – but how should we feel that it’s easier to listen to him threatening to rape his grandmother on The Marshall Mathers LP, that there’s more for our souls to soak up from the vivid misogynistic murder he depicted on “Kim”, more to laugh at? Many believe that Eminem’s been unlistenable since 2004, but those folks are urged to return to Encore, where he apologized for past racism without tying himself in knots, and utilized slapstick and novelty sound effects like an actual entertainer. Or even The Marshall Mathers LP 2 from just four years ago, where he made a few of the same moves and actually had fun, like reflecting on his career over Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good” or busting out a classic Rick Rubin Beasties beat for “Bezerk”. It’s a genuine shame, but Revival is the most pleasureless record he’s ever made, so stymied by his worst tendencies that like many other inept apologies from 2017 it only points out how much further he has to go rather than how far he’s come.\\n\\nEssential Tracks: N/A',\n",

       " 'Fiend Folio: 10 Silliest Monsters\\n\\nOh AD&D Fiend Folio! You\\'ve got a lot to answer for! If you don\\'t remember this venerable companion to the original Monster Manual, though it contained many cool additions to the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse, it also had some really whacky ideas - monsters based on puns, odd amalgamations of other creatures, and living traps with no semblance of an ecology. I suppose that\\'s what happens when a bestiary is assembled mostly from White Dwarf readers\\' submissions. The Fiend Factory column might as well have been called Dial M for Monster. Thankfully, I really dig Russ Nicholson\\'s art, and he\\'s probably the reason I used so many critters from Fiend Folio in my teen years. Still, some of them are completely ridiculous. How ridiculous? Stick around...\\n\\nHonorable Mention: TweenNot silly per se - it\\'s a ghostly halo that follows someone around and gives them good luck - but the name hasn\\'t aged well. Were it designed today, the Tween would be much, much, much more monstrous.\\n\\n10. GambadoThe Fiend Folio is full of living traps that look like they were genetically designed by Grimtooth the Troll. There\\'s a flat fish with spikes in its back, and a cousin of the rust monster that disenchants items, and (gross) throat leeches... The silliest in my opinion is the Gambado (from the French gambader, \"to frolic\" WTF?). The adventurers see a skull on the ground, or a pile of skulls. What they don\\'t know is that the skull is only the head of a devious creature whose body is basically a big spring. It bungees at them and snaps them back into its hole to be devoured. BOING!!!!!\\n\\n9. RothéToy water buffalo. They live underground, but there\\'s no indication of what demi-humans might herd them or use them as steeds or whatnot. Nope, they\\'re just tiny underground buffalo. Yep.\\n\\n8. ThorkTo me, this seems like a case of \"found object\". Guy (in this case, creator Mark Barnes) sees a copper stork in someone\\'s yard, comes home and writes up a monster for White Dwarf magazine. The Thork, or \"Boiler Bird\", is a bird made of copper that spits boiling water at its foes. It collects platinum pieces and ONLY platinum pieces so raiding its nest can be worth it. One of nature\\'s many niches.\\n\\n7. AdhererA mummy wrapped in sticky tape. I\\'d be evil too if I had stuff sticking to my ass all the time.\\n\\n6. CarbuncleSo there\\'s this armadillo with a precious ruby in its forehead, see? And the ruby turns into dust if it dies, though it can give it away if coaxed by a wizard. And it can will itself to die because it has no concept or fear of death. And it seeks out adventuring parties and telepathically communicates the value of its ruby to them. And then uses its low intelligence to somehow sow the seeds of discord between party members, attracting monsters all the while. Is this anything but a device to hose the PCs? And what PC would fall for it? As soon as the Carbuncle (way to steal the name of another animal, btw) tells the average party the value of of its gem, that\\'s the end of its non-fighting ass.\\n\\n5. GarbugWhat do you get when you give a lobster butterfly wings? Imagine a crazy swarm of these things. Now imagine that they\\'re 9 FEET LONG! Comes in two colors!\\n\\n4. Flail SnailHey! Flail rhymes with Snail! How in heck did such a creature ever evolve? (Answer: yeah yeah, they\\'re all magical experiments gone wrong.) It\\'s a giant snail with multiple flails instead of a head, for Pete\\'s sake! And its shell acts as a robe of scintillating colors that deflects magic! Why am I still talking about it?! \\'Nuff said!\\n\\n3. BlindheimThe Blindheim has a name as unlikely as its biology. It\\'s a giant frog with headlights for eyes. Its main diet consists of deer.\\n\\n2. XvartWhat if Smurfs were a D&D monster? These little blue men are exactly that. Chaotic evil Smurfs. They apparently delight in torture, so we can only guess at how their creator was exposed to Peyo\\'s version. Gargamel was WRONGED!!!\\n\\n1. FlumphNo surprise here! There can only be one #1 and it\\'s the Flumph. This flat, floating, airborne jellyfish can emit a foul-smelling liquid and moves by sucking in air and blowing it out its behind. It is a flying whoopee cushion. And I wish I could give you permission to massacre the useless little things, but it\\'s Lawful Good, so it\\'s on your side. Maybe someone Chaotic can flip it over and disable it. My Lord, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!\\n\\nOr perhaps you have other nominees? At least the book can\\'t be called boring (a label I\\'d attach to the Monster Manual II) and they\\'re not ALL bad. Next week: Fiend Folio\\'s best and most enduring!\\n\\nSome of these make me wonder if the \"designer\" was basically trying to come up with game stats for some weird little plastic toy figure he got out of a gumball machine and wanted to use as a monster in lieu of an actual gaming miniature.',\n",

       " 'Length 1:38:24 Date: Mar. 5, 2016\\n\\nSize Matters in Politics and in Sex\\n\\nBy Dr. Susan Block\\n\\nIt’s ironic, or perhaps it’s utterly fitting, that we kick off Women’s History (Herstory?) Month 2016 with an impassioned national conversation about male members.\\n\\nYes, the Grand Old Party’s mighty contenders have taken the U.S. presidential debate below the belt, contesting penis size or, more specifically, hand size, which is said to be correlated to penis size, though scientific studies of this anatomical urban legend say otherwise.\\n\\nWhether or not such measurements are meaningful in matters of governance or one’s lover’s pleasure, the size of Donald Trump’s hands, and more specifically, the shortness of his fingers, have been a major topic of political discussion and media attention, shoving economic issues, perma-war, world affairs, environmental degradation, health care and poverty off the table with one firm slap. Call it a political “bitch slap,” if you will, but here we are, smarting.\\n\\nTruth be told, if truth is ever told where a Trump is involved, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter first called the Republican frontrunner a “short-fingered vulgarian” in crafty old Spy Magazine over 20 years ago, apparently cracking Trumpty Dumpty’s eggshell ego, as ever since the remark was made, the disturbed billionaire has regularly sent Carter pictures of his expensively manicured digits encircled in gold Sharpie (rest assured, the Trump Organization executive office has a supply closet stacked with gold Sharpies) with captions like “See, not so short!”\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle Marco Attacks Trumpty’s Short-Cummings\\n\\nThe exhibitionist finger pix also makes the big Agent Orange-haired hulk fair game for all (not that he ever wasn’t). Last week, desperately trying to attract attention to his own limp and shriveling campaign, Marco Rubio, aka. “Little Marco” (so named by Mr. Short-Fingers) resurrected the meme and used it to attack Trump, the frontrunner you love to hate, the walking squawking poster boy for hypocrisy, greed and brutishness so loathed by Rubio supporters and other Old-Guard Establishment Repubs… even though the GOP has always been the party of hypocrisy, greed and brutishness, just not in such a vulgar short-fingered fashion.\\n\\nLittle Marco was practically drooling as he tossed his meme meat into the gaping maw of the gossip-hungry press: “He (Trump) is like 6’2,” squeaked Little Marco, “which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5’2. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can’t trust them.”\\n\\nWill this incisive political conclusion cause Trumpty Dumpty to fall off his wall… or at least get egg on his face? Or does it just reveal that Little Marco is a Size Queen?\\n\\nRepublican Sex Therapy\\n\\nBecause there’s something else “they say about men with small hands,” which Trumpty himself spelled out (almost) when he squealed like a smashed egg might, if a smashed egg could squeal. “He hit my hands! Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?” Trump practically cried big egg-yolky tears right there on the Motor City Fox Theatre stage.\\n\\nThen with a mighty effort and a great showing of hands, Trumpty oratorically pushed aside the broken pieces of his shell, pulling his Confidence Man act out of the slimy fetal mess, to boast, “And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.”\\n\\nThese “debates” are starting to sound like one of my sex therapy sessions.\\n\\nTry Penis-Fencing, the Bonobo Way\\n\\nBut the proof is in the pudding or, in this case, the pants. So come on, boys—Trumpty Dumpty and Little Marco, Creepy Ted and the rest—quit talking with your hands (and out your ass), just whip out your weapons, and penis-fence already. You know you want to!\\n\\nIt’s what male bonobos do. And it’s actually not as silly—or “dirty”—as your so-called debates and certainly not as dangerous to the populace as your warmongering, your gun fetish, your military adoration and your romance with bigotry. In fact, the fine art of penis fencing is one reason why bonobos have never been seen killing each other in the wild or captivity. I call it The Bonobo Way of peace through pleasure.\\n\\nAmerica’s Self-Love Affair with Its Own Dicks\\n\\nAs a sex therapist, I’ve often thought about America’s self-love affair with its own dicks, especially since that ultimate American castration, the cutting down of the quintessentially phallic Twin Towers, Big Dick I and Big Dick II, epitomizing American humiliation in a fiery, fuming emasculation, shown ‘round the world to friends and enemies, over and over again. Maybe I’m just a little cock-crazy myself, because then in 2002, Bush’s threat to invade Iraq, coupled with Saddam’s boasting about the WMD he didn’t have, seemed to me to be just a big “Cockfight in the Baghdad Corral.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s too bad that those two political dickheads didn’t conduct a real cockfight (or better yet, penis-fencing) to solve their differences. Instead, Bush, on the advice of that other dangerous Donald (Rumsfeld), invaded Iraq with a “Bukkake Bombing Crusade” followed by the devastating Anglo-American “Rape of Iraq” from which the Cradle of Civilization still hasn’t recovered. No doubt, penis-fencing—or some form of bonoboësque resource-sharing diplomacy—would be far better for the 99% than all this perma-war. Make sperm wars, not real wars!\\n\\nIn any case, Trumpty’s junk is not going away. He probably won’t accept Larry Flynt’s offer to have his doctors examine it to determine if he’s as “big” a guy as his “guarantee” implies. Though we might look forward to Melania or one of the previous wives making some sort of playful endorsement of the teetering Trump Tower.\\n\\nIs Bigger Always Better?\\n\\nThat being said, the question remains: Does size matter—in sex or politics? In terms of sex, there are studies that say that women feel penis size matters (such women usually prefer bigger guys for one-night-stands, while opting for smaller sizes for relationships), and then there are studies that say size doesn’t matter to most women. It certainly isn’t required to give a woman an Earth-shattering orgasm, as that usually takes external clitoral touch or perhaps G-spot stimulation. The G-spot being located about an inch or two inside on the roof of the vaginal cave, it is most easily reached with a clever crooked finger, not a big cock.\\n\\nNevertheless, many people, most of whom are men, are obsessed with penis size as a *potent* symbol of manhood, in which case it does matter… a lot. And that could deeply and profoundly affect your sexuality, your politics, or just your sense of proportion… especially if you have no sense of humor.\\n\\nFor instance, it has been recently reported that in the land where Trump’s forebears went by the surname “Drumpf” (making him Trumpty Drumpfty?), a certain Adolf Hitler suffered from “a rare condition called penile hypospadias (a birth defect) in which the urethra opens on the underside of the penis.” Not only did hypospadias leave Der Führer with a “micropenis,” but it also caused him to urinate from a hole on the shaft as opposed to the tip. Did genital deformity contribute to Adolf’s genocidal rage and jack-booted fury? Seems likely. But a small or even a deformed penis alone does not Der Fuehrer make. Not every kid who gets bullied on the playground becomes a mass murderer. It’s a lot about attitude.\\n\\nThe attitude of Trumpty Drumpfty (said by ex-wife Ivana to have kept Hitler’s speeches by his bedside, with eerie similarities to his own, as pointed out by Bill Mahr)? Aside from his “Me first, and the hell with everybody else,” point of view, it’s the American credo of capitalism: bigger is better.\\n\\nAside from the size of our dicks (which are, internationally speaking, a little below average), in what ways are we bigger, and is it better? America still has the world’s biggest economy, though China is expected to surpass us soon. We also have the biggest Military-Industrial Complex, and the biggest Prison-Industrial Complex, with the most people in prison, many locked up for non-violent crimes. We have massive over-population and an obesity epidemic. These are some ways in which we are bigger. Is that better?\\n\\nSometimes, it’s better to be small.\\n\\nPHOTOS: ONO BO\\n\\nBig Hands, Buck Rogers, Foot Fetish & Chastity Bites for Women’s Month\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of size, Patrick Jankiewicz, a gigantic World Trade Tower of a man, is our featured guest on this show. You were wondering when I was going to get around to talking about the show, weren’t you?\\n\\nStanding 6’9”, Mr. Jankiewicz (rhymes with Weird Al Yankovic, who could be his cousin but isn’t) dwarfs the shrimpy 6’2” Donald. Though we don’t get to view his penis, we do see his hands and they are super-sized. His feet are the size of watermelons. Whole families of certain species could live on these feet, especially considering the state of his sneakers, which are titanic.\\n\\nPat is an author/actor/comic/journalist from the great American Midwest, visiting Bonoboville for the first time courtesy of the congenial Joe Williamson. He’s the author of “Just When You Thought It was Safe: A Jaws Companion,” (which brings up the unmistakably penile proportions of sharks, especially in Jaws promos) “You Wouldn’t Like Me When I’m Angry: A Hulk Companion” (or a Trump companion?) plus his newest book, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: A TV Companion, which we use for book–spankings. Pat has also appeared in such films and TV series as MTV’s “Death Valley,” “The Sarah Silverman Program” and “Fangoria’s Blood and Guts with Scott Ian.”\\n\\nTroma films notwithstanding, I am generally not a horror fan. All that “blood and guts” makes me lose my popcorn. But I do appreciate the art, politics and subversive humor that often gets embedded into the horror genre—in part because, in our sex-negative society, horror is more acceptable than porn, or even nudity. After all, if a woman shows her breasts on film, that’s an R rating and if she makes love, that’s XXX, but if she’s simply murdered, blood and guts spraying, that’s totally PG.\\n\\nThough I’ve only seen the trailer, I tip my Women’s History Month-conscious hat to Chastity Bites (written by a woman, the talented Lotti Parriss Knowles) for being delightfully pro-sex and female-empowering, a campy satire of sleazy abstinence-only high school programs that force or trick teens into “promising” to remain virgins until marriage. Interestingly, Pat plays a gardener with a foot fetish which, in real life, embarrasses the big guy, especially when the fabulous Dayton Rains—award-winning porn star, webcam and phone therapist with the Institute—and I play footsie as we chat.\\n\\nLA Laker Riots & Book-Spankings\\n\\nPat is an actor, and he acts the part of the big unsuspecting rube in Bonoboville and, in a way, he is. However, like a good journalist, he knows things about me that I’ve long forgotten, painting a vivid picture of himself watching the LA Laker Riots of 2000, and seeing my name on a banner by the Blue Line, lit up by a car on fire—an iconic LA moment. It took me a minute to remember hearing about this incident when Bonoboville was on Flower Street near the Staples Center but, this being before the Era of Youtube, no one sent me a link to the video that Pat apparently saw. Maybe now someone will!\\n\\nPat is slightly submissive—which is a good quality in a giant like him—getting down on the floor and saying “Yes, Ma’am” a lot. But he’s also a bit stubborn, such as when he insists on favoring mandrills over bonobos (maybe because male mandrills are twice the size of females which is, approximately, Pat’s proportion in relation to Dayton and me). By the end of the show, Pat is wisely conceding that bonobos are far more interesting than mandrills, and lumbering over Dayton’s knee as I spank him with The Bonobo Way. His only request: that I spank him with his Buck Rogers book too.\\n\\nBonoboville Communion with Green Blood of Agwa\\n\\nFirst on this show to take Bonoboville Communion is Gonzo Bonobo in honor of his third anniversary as a citizen of Bonoboville. Gonzo licks it up in style from Dayton’s award-winning 32DDD altar, leaving the Altar Girl (now stripped down to nothing but her panties, subsequently donated to Panty Boy) asking for more.\\n\\nPHOTOS 1 & 3: ONO BO. PHOTO 2: MAX. PHOTO 4: UNSCENE ABE\\n\\nPat was a Catholic altar boy, so he knows all about communion. Maybe he knows too much. When he drops down on his knees, it seems like he’s still standing up, so it’s a little difficult to get him into position. Here’s where size can be a distinct liability. Shy, he just gives a quick lick to the shoulder, but he enthusiastically “gets lei’ed” and leans back like a human landslide—almost burying tiny Dayton—to receive the bright green “blood” of Agwa Herbal Coca Leaf Liqueur that our Altar Girl manages to pour religiously down his throat. Lloyd Kaufman and the Class of Nuke ‘Em High would be proud. Though Dayton was just happen to survive the avalanche… and even invited the avalanche himself to her upcoming Bonoboville Birthday Bash next Saturday, March 19.\\n\\n\\n\\nHedy Lamarr: Sexpot Genius\\n\\nSize matters aside, I want to end this blog as I begin this show: with a real female-empowering Women’s History Month tribute to an amazing woman: the late great Hedy Lamarr (one of Capt’n Max’s favorites), the gorgeous sexy part-Jewish Austrian actress who starred in the 1933 movie Ecstasy where she had the first on-camera masturbatory orgasm. Though the film notoriously shows her swimming and running naked through fields, her famous “orgasm” only shows her ecstatically beautiful face. Then she went Hollywood, starring in many popular films, from Algiers to Samson and Delilah.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Hedy wasn’t *just* a hottie. This beauty had brains, remarkably co-inventing a groundbreaking radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, using spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the Axis powers’ attempts at jamming. The principles of Hedy’s invention are now incorporated into modern Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology, leading to her induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.\\n\\nSo there you have her: One of the world’s sexiest women, who was an early porn star, also co-invented wireless technology.

       " 'Transgender Woman Freaks Out At GameStop Employee for Calling Her “Sir”\\n\\nGameStop is known for giving incredible rates for the purchased of used items. It appears as if this transgender woman wasn’t happy with the fact that she would be getting in-store credit instead of cash. However, that wasn’t the only think that pissed her off. The store worker either by accident or on purpose to piss her off called her a “sir”. To which the employee insists that he said “you guys” in general to the group of people. To add insult to injury, after the transgender woman begins freaking out at the store employee another customer with a child says “excuse me sir…” which appeared to push the transgender woman over the top.\\n\\nAfter going on a rant about being mis-gendered the trans woman throws a fit. Kicking over boxes, yelling and asking for the corporate number that can easily be Googled. During the heated dispute the woman asks if the employee would like to go out to the parking lot for a fight, to which the employee declines. Once it’s all over on the way out the door the woman makes sure the employee feels bad by saying\\n\\n“I’m going to tell the entire LGBT community about this and you’re going to lose money over this.”\\n\\nIt’s unclear if the woman was either having a bad day, on drugs or just completely mentally unstable. Since the video went viral on Reddit there has been no comment from GameStop if any action was taken on the employee.

       " 'In an extensive Rolling Stone interview published Wednesday, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert talks at length about the guilt he feels about being a privileged white male in America, the #MeToo movement, and the “fantasy world” he says President Donald Trump lives in.\\n\\nAmong Stephen Colbert’s hottest takes is that it is a “dark feeling” to feel good about being “white male Christian, American, straight.”\\n\\nIn the interview, Colbert was asked, “You once said that The Colbert Report was a 10-year confession. Could you elaborate on that idea a little more?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe responded with a long, meandering answer, telling Rolling Stone in part, “It’s two things: It was a confession and it was a question at the same time. It had a thesis statement about what feels right to you, as opposed to what is supported by fact. That’s the thesis statement of the entire 10 years. But the question was, why am I, Stephen Colbert — white, male, straight, Christian, American — a hegemonic figure? In my life, I don’t just mean in character.”\\n\\nThe 54-year-old also said, “I’m like, ‘Yeah, fuck yeah, me, me. Me, white male Christian, American, straight. Number one!’ That is a dark feeling, because it is indulging in an appetite for yourself, it’s very possessive, it’s very consumptive, it’s pornographic, and so the confession is: Yes, I have these feelings as well. But the question is: Why are those feelings indulged in America?”\\n\\nColbert also commented on the #MeToo movement. “Did you have general thoughts about, perhaps, men being worse than you imagined?” Rolling Stone‘s Brian Hiatt asked the CBS host.\\n\\n“I imagine men to be pretty bad, so that’s not that shocking,” Colbert answered. “I never had a great expectation for the sexual behavior of men, but this has certainly lowered the bar even further.”\\n\\nFinally, Colbert went after President Trump, calling him a “heretic against reality” who “lives in this fantasy world where only his emotions count and therefore only his reality is real.”\\n\\nLast month, the late-night host called Trump a “racist, horny old burger-goblin.”',\n",

Then went back to the Fox interview and heard this...\\n\\nFor as far back as I can remember, Fox has assaulted me and my ideals with absolute CRAP pertaining to entertainment and information. They always seem to make the wrong decisions at the worst time. As stated in EA\\'s response to Fox their request is NOT a legal threat, but I believe that it could quickly lead to that if Fox isn\\'t more careful in the future. In light of the writers strike, which if I remember correctly is affecting many networks, Fox\\'s blatant disregard of correct information about the game could easily be interpreted as an attempt to lead parents to get their kids to watch TV instead of play a game that is obviously more popular than reruns and poorly written soap-operas. This translates into a purposeful attack on the video game industry.\\n\\nNow after admitting that everything I have said has been repeated endlessly both here and else ware, I just wanted to express my outrage at Fox for their own stupidity and disrespect towards something that may one day be a staple of our economy. Video games. I consider video games not only a great way to entertain people, but as an excellent way to teach. Just the other day I was reading a story about some guy who saved 2 people\\'s lives because of some basic first aid he had learned while playing a military based video game in a medic training mode. I could add MANY other examples for this, but I want to remain on topic if I can.\\n\\nAt any rate Fox owes the ENTIRE video game industry an official apology, not just EA and the creators of Mass Effect.\\n\\nI may be a couple days......okay, a couple months late on this, but all I can say is......What. The. Hell. I never thought I would see something like this. And oddly enough I never seen this till now, insane I know but I somehow avoided everything having to do with Jack Thompson and Mass Effect.

And before you tell me it’s not that simple, it actually is.\\n\\nTonight in our @USLChampionship game; a player from @RoughnecksFC called me the N-word not once but twice on the field to try to insult me. I told the ref but the game cont’d 🤷🏾\\u200d♂️…We really need to put a stop to this nonsense @EnergyFC. Love over hate — Atiba Harris (@AtibaHarris) April 28, 2019\\n\\nWhen a word has as much historical content as the word that was said to Atiba Harris during the TulsaRoughnecks FC vs. OKC Energy FC match, it means a lot of different things to different people. But, what’s not debated is the history and the effect the word has had in American culture. Fabian Bastidas doubled down on using the word, twice (and boy do I love when people keeping digging themselves deeper), by saying, where he comes from it’s normal to say the word to people as a sign of love and endearment. He mentions New York and I myself, can confirm while living in Brooklyn for five years, I was astounded by the amount of non-black people saying it to each other. I grew up in the South though, where saying that in public as a non-black person could bring certain consequences. But regardless of where he’s from and the context he meant the word in, Fabian shouldn’t have said it and should never say it. Really, it’s that easy. Instead of making this a long essay about it, here are two very simple reasons to put this to bed.\\n\\nYou’re at work\\n\\nBefore I get into the moral and logical reason, let’s start with the common-sense reason. Soccer is an entertaining and competitive activity that may not feel like a job, but it is for Fabian (well, it was). There are certain rules you have to abide by at your job and this isn’t any different. There are words, phrases, and even topics you’d never discuss at your job because you know the consequences it could bring. I don’t care if your best friend is working with you and you’ve said it to each other as a term of endearment for years. If your boss or a coworker hears it and doesn’t like it, you’re getting written up or fired. And that’s an example with someone you know personally, which brings me to my biggest and easily the most logical reason you shouldn’t say racially charged words to random people despite the context of how you think you’re using it…\\n\\nYOU DON’T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, THEIR EXPERIENCES, AND PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE WORD!!!\\n\\nFor someone who uses the word so casually, you would think Fabian would understand why some people would not like the word and especially, why they wouldn’t want to be referred to as the word. My experiences of being black and growing up in Georgia is a lot different than his not being black and growing up in New York City or wherever he calls home (I don’t care at this point). So, with that in mind, you’d think the most logical and moral driven action regarding the word would be “I should probably not use this word to a person I don’t know, because their interpretation and feelings towards the word might be different than mine.” But no, Fabian doubled down on the entitlement and stupidity by posting this on Instagram:\\n\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bw0pdnenUSy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\\n\\nI read a tweet last year involving the US Open Cup fiasco where LAFC’s player Adama Diomande said he was called a racial slur by a Portland Timber’s player during their match. The tweet explained that a source said Dio was called the N-word by an American black player but Dio not being from America, took it offensively, not understanding the player did not mean it in an offensive way. And that’s the point I am making, people. It doesn’t matter the context you mean it in, it doesn’t matter who gave you “a pass” to say it, and it doesn’t matter if you personally wouldn’t be offended. People (especially black people) can be offended by the word itself no matter how you are conveying the context. And if that doesn’t make sense to you, tuck your entitlement back in.\\n\\nTulsa immediately responded to the situation by releasing Fabian from the team. A move which has since been called an overreaction and unnecessary. But in a game where it feels every week, we see racist chants, bananas, and items being thrown at players, and even coaches downplaying the blatant racism that’s happening to their players, what does no tolerance mean to you? Because it’s easy to retweet a statement that racism should have no part in the game but then when Tulsa sees a moment where racism happened and eliminates it from the game, you’re not practicing what you preach by calling it an overreaction, are you? Atiba, a black man, felt a type of way about a non-black person referring to him as a word that was meant for years to dehumanize men that looked just like Atiba. And he had every right to feel that type of way. Fabian doesn’t know Atiba’s background and feelings toward the word, I don’t know it, and unless this is Atiba reading this, neither do you.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if your black spouse, your Hot Topic shopping black friend from middle school who listened to Limp Bizkit with you, or even Atiba himself gave you a “pass,” Black or white, just don’t say it around people you don’t know. I couldn’t care less what you do in the privacy of your home where your woke white spouse puts a little Lawry’s on her dry @$$ chicken and blows your mind. But, when you are publicly justifying the ideology that you’re okay with the word being said, it diminishes the culture, fight, and personal feelings that people associate with that word. It provides subjective tones that allows an excuse for people to feel comfortable saying it or question why they can/can’t say. So just don’t say it.',\n",

Two Republicans (one elected, one running for office) recently said vulgar and ignorant things:\\n\\nI am the face of the Re-Pube-Licking Party.\\n\\nI like boobies.—two posts from Robert Morrow, Chairman-elect, Travis County, on his Twitter feed posted 48 hours after being elected.\\n\\nThe dinosaurs on [Noah’s] ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce.

Because in this election cycle it would be a lot easier to argue that your party shouldn’t be judged by people who spread weird Obama conspiracy theories and brag about their dicks if that didn’t also describe your presumptive nominee for the Presidency.\\n\\nWhich means we should feel free to evaluate the Democratic Party and its presumptive nominees for the Presidency (whose actions are rarely scrutinized on the show) by their choices. It’s not hard to do so as there isn’t that much to choose from.\\n\\nThe Democratic party isn’t opposed to tactless quips: Clinton’s response (a response CODEPINK describes as “sociopathic“) to the extrajudicial murder of Muammar Gaddafi, “We came, we saw, he died.” draws little examination then or now even though she was in power and on-duty when she said it in a televised interview. The Democratic Party apparently likes war (Sen. Clinton voted for the 2003 Iraq war), trashing water supplies in the name of big business commerce (Clinton doesn’t mind fracking), doing whatever they can to appease the HMOs and prevent universalizing the US’ extant single-payer healthcare delivery system (Clinton is a long-time backer of this in various guises dating back to her days as First Lady through her interviews where she insists universalizing Medicare is not possible), propping up dictators (Democrats and Republicans have done this for decades), and killing people (including Americans) in drone attacks justified with mere suspicion of wrongdoing (no published evidence, no public trial) as well as members of their families who are suspected of doing nothing wrong (Secretary of State Clinton participated in this).\\n\\n“The Administration plans not to say how many innocents it thinks it killed in any strike—it will only offer a bland ‘aggregate assessment’ of innocent dead,” said Cori Crider, Reprieve attorney for drone strike victims. “Contrast this to last April, when the President named—and apologized—for the deaths of two innocent Westerners, Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto. To Yemenis and Pakistanis who live under US drones every day, the contrast could not be clearer.”\\n\\nWhen matters are put this way these two parties look similarly horrific, neither uniquely worthy of scorn more than the other, neither deserving a lack of criticism.',\n",

I knew he was talking about sex.\"\\n\\nClancy then told the boy to call him and promised that he was \"not going to kidnap the child,\" police say.\\n\\nAccording to the cops, Clancy said he was going to put a bottle of vodka and some condoms in the saddlebag of his motorcycle and meet with the boy. He told the boy to wear the \"sexiest underwear you got,\" the report says.\\n\\nClancy showed up to the designated meeting spot one afternoon last week, and -- of course -- the cops arrested him. Condoms and alcohol were found in the saddlebags on the motorcycle, police say.\\n\\nThe cops say Clancy told police he thought the boy was 17 but conceded that it was wrong to speak with the kid, according to the report.\\n\\nClancy has been charged with one count of child exploitation, one count of traveling to meet a minor to engage in an unlawful sex act, and one count of possessing child pornography. He faces a total maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\\n\\nIf you like this story, consider signing up for our email newsletters.',\n",

       " 'While many Republicans who have already endorsed Trump have been publicly denouncing his \"grab [women] by the p*ssy\" comments, John Oliver is not letting them off the hook so easy.\\n\\nIn a pre-taped segment before the second presidential debate, Oliver unpacked the situation surrounding the leaked footage of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.\\n\\nOliver pointed out Trump\\'s apology was far from adequate given the breadth of the accusations against him.\\n\\n\"First, he claims he’s never said he’s a perfect person—which, of course, is a lie,\" Oliver says, then continuing, \"Then he said he never pretended to be someone he’s not right before claiming ‘these words don’t reflect who I am’—which is absolutely absurd. They could not capture his essence more if they were spoken by a spray-tanned Furby eating KFC and screaming at a Gold Star family.\"\\n\\nOliver also noted that Republicans have been coming out of the woodwork to distance themselves from Trump\\'s comments, but their reasoning for doing so leaves much to be desired.\\n\\nMany Republicans, such as Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz, reason that their mothers, wives and daughters are the reason why Donald Trump\\'s comments are wrong, rather than giving expressions of equal rights.\\n\\n\"As the son of a mother and a husband of a wife — what the f*ck does that have to do with anything?

John McCain even said that \"[Trump] alone bears the the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences,\" in reaction to the footage.\\n\\nHowever, to Oliver (and to many voters), the Republican distancing comes a little too late.\\n\\n\"Except no, he alone does not bear the burden of his conduct, because he alone did not make himself your party’s nominee,\" he said.\\n\\n\"All of you still thought he should be president. So the only way you get to be shocked and outraged now is if you were cryogenically frozen until Friday afternoon and that Access Hollywood tape was the first thing you saw upon being reanimated.

       " 'Determining the likelihood of malignancy in solitary pulmonary nodules with Bayesian analysis. Part I. Theory.\\nOnly two radiographic findings allow reliable distinction of benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. Intuitively, it is clear that other radiographic and clinical findings should also be important in making this distinction. Subjectively incorporating these other findings into the decision of whether a nodule is benign or malignant is difficult. Likelihood ratios, which indicate the degree of malignancy or benignity represented by a test result or clinical finding, can be combined by means of the Bayes theorem to quantitate the probability of malignancy of a given nodule. From a literature survey, likelihood ratios were derived for six radiographic and four clinical characteristics associated with solitary pulmonary nodules. There were a total of 15 malignant and 19 benign findings, the most important of which were radiographic characteristics. For malignant nodules, the most important radiographic characteristics were thickness of the cavity wall spicular edge, and diameter of over 3 cm. For benign nodules, the most important radiographic characteristics were benign growth rate and a benign pattern of calcification.',\n",

       " 'The Top 7... Cringeworthy Kisses\\n\\nWhen these characters lock lips, the results are more repulsive than romantic\\n\\nExcept here! Since videogames are notoriously inept at rendering romance on the screen, we’re celebrating the “holiday” with these seven most embarrassing and excruciating examples. Beware - the following kisses are so bizarre, so disgusting or so damn awkward that they could literally cause you physical pain.\\n\\nLet’s get ready to gag, shall we?\\n\\nThe game: Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)\\n\\nThe couple: One is a spiky-haired teenager known for his record-breaking speed and epic adventures. The other is a fair and kind-hearted princess, kidnapped from her kingdom by nefarious evildoers. More importantly, one is a friggin’ hedgehog and the other is a human being.\\n\\nThe moment of horror: Can we just get this one out of the way, please? We could accept the interspecies thing, even if watching Elise kiss Sonic is the equivalent of watching Cinderella make out with Mickey Mouse. We could forget the constant cuddling, heavy petting and shiny-eyed soul-searching, even if their inclusion reduced an already terrible game into possibly the worst game of this decade.\\n\\nWhat we will never, ever forgive is the excuse this infamous scene gave to the internet... a free pass to produce as many nauseating montage clips as YouTube could hold. Did the world really need to see Sonic and Elise rolling through the grass to the tune of “A Whole New World”? Was Amy’s jealousy truly worthy of a “Sk8ter Boi” tribute? Are fans seriously dividing themselves into “SonElise” and “SonAmy” camps?\\n\\nThe couple: Carla is a claustrophobic police detective who falls in love with the brutal murderer she was supposed to arrest. Lucas is a simple computer technician who not only becomes that murderer, but also gains the powers of telekinesis and flight. Compared to the cringeworthy circumstances surrounding their kiss, however, these descriptions seem almost mundane...\\n\\nThe moment of horror: Remember the end of The Sixth Sense, when you discovered that Bruce Willis was a ghost? Now imagine that Bruce Willis was a frozen corpse and that The Sixth Sense ended with a graphic sex scene. That’s what you’re forced to experience in Indigo Prophecy.\\n\\nYes, the albino complexion is no coincidence. That dude is dead and that lady is totally sucking his rotting cadaver face. Stranger still, he died by falling off a roller coaster. Strangest of all, she ends up marrying him and carrying his baby. We’re pretty sure he’s alive again by that point, but considering how ridiculously screwed up this game is during its second half, we can’t be sure. She might be a pregnant roller coaster and he might be a dead baby. The kiss might be less creepy that way.',\n",

       " '5. THE MUMMY (1999)\\n\\nAfter an adventuring American stumbles across the tomb of an ancient mummy, he is recruited to return to the cursed place in order to help a team recover a lost artifact. But they get more than they bargained for when they awaken the creature and unleash a plague upon the world.\\n\\nNow, I know many readers will give me crap over this movie, but give me a chance to explain. First of all, THE MUMMY is not to be compared to the original whatsoever and really has to be looked at as its own beast. The special effects are not to be underestimated and, even though the movie was made in 1999, if at all possible watch this on Blu-ray as the re-creation of the glorious Egyptian ruins etc are another high point of the movie. Imhotep is, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying villains in recent memory and is brought to life superbly by Arnold Vosloo.\\n\\nThat isn’t all, though. Fans who say that this movie isn’t true horror or provides little to no scares might be forgetting the monstrous zombies, the nightmarish flying locusts, and the fallen skies. Sure, it’s tough to take the movie seriously at times, but you have to praise director Stephen Sommers and the cast for pulling off such a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.\\n\\nOverall THE MUMMY is a great watch for someone with a mild interest in the genre who could possibly ease into it. It provides a few genuine chills, some hilarious dialogue and fantastic action scenes with amazing FX throughout. All this is neatly packaged together and doesn’t feel super cliche. A must watch for newcomers.\\n\\n4. SCREAM (1996)\\n\\nA year after the murder of her mother, a teenage girl is terrorized by a killer who targets his victims using horror films as part of a deadly game.\\n\\nRegarded by many (including this writer) as one of the few movies that forever changed slasher flicks, SCREAM is the work of a true Master of Horror… Wes Craven. Having previously created icons like Freddy Krueger, Craven struck gold with another horror icon, the sinister and violent Ghostface.\\n\\nTo say this movie is self-aware is to summarize its central premise, as the film uses genre cliches for the cast to discuss as if they were in a horror movie…. This brainy approach will certainly appeal to those who think all horror movies are dumb, all the while giving them kill scenes that are tense and violent. The film kicks off with an incredible scene which really sets the bar for the rest of the movie.\\n\\nIf you watch SCREAM and enjoy it, I encourage you to bust out the popcorn for a series marathon. Aither way, it’s a must-see for any aspiring fan (and even some of the seasoned vets). Bottom line: a true horror masterpiece.\\n\\n3. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999)\\n\\nThree film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind.\\n\\nThese days I feel that movies, especially horror movies, can be made more for the makers and less for the audience. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT turns that idea completely on its head and gives you an entire different look/feel for the genre. This isn’t the stereotypical creature feature; the fear of the unknown is this movies strongest trait. Before I saw this movie I never really realised how terrifying the idea of not knowing what is out there could be. My imagination ran wild with what ifs and terrified me more than most movie monsters ever did!\\n\\nAnother component of the film is the characters’ slow decent into madness as their spirits are broken and their hope dwindles. The performances are incredibly believable and the entire plot and backstory of the Blair Witch is certainly unique and believable, adding immeasurably to the creepy factor.\\n\\n2. TRICK R TREAT (2007)\\n\\nFive interwoven tales that occur on Halloween night: an everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met Mr. Right; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank; a woman who loathes the night has to contend with her holiday-obsessed husband; and a mean old man meets his match with a demonic, supernatural trick-or-treater.\\n\\nJust when it looked like the horror anthology was dead, along comes director/writer Michael Dougherty’s TRICK R’ TREAT to re-establish it as a pinnacle of contemporary filmmaking. This movie is 100% rewatchability every single Halloween without fail.\\n\\nI can’t think of a movie that encapsulates the look and feel of the season quite like this: from kids trick or treating to the suburban streets covered in decorations, Dougherty captures the mood and tone of Halloween. The stories intertwine for a clever and satisfying payoff, making this an instant cult classic which is set for a new installment soon.\\n\\n1. DEAD SILENCE (2007)\\n\\nFrom the brilliant horror masters that brought us the Saw franchise, comes a taste of true fear. The story takes place after Jamie Ashen comes home to find his wife Lisa disfigured and dead in their apartment just minutes after a mysterious, not to mention creepy, package was left on their doorstep containing an old ventriloquist dummy. With no alibi, a detective is left to assume Jamie as the prime suspect. Driven by an old ghost story, Jamie returns to Ravens Fair, his old hometown to prove his innocence. The story leads him to believe that the vengeful ghost of Mary Shaw was the real murderer. But when Jamie returns to Ravens Fair, he finds out more than he bargained for.\\n\\nBefore you watch this movie, ask yourself this whether you have nightmares easily. If your answer is in the affirmative, then maybe you should rethink watching this movie. You may find yourself spending many nights awake with vivid images from the film burned into your mind. The story is intriguing, the atmosphere is heavy, and coloured by the creepy music of Saw’s Charlie Clouser. I was surprised with the amount of gore in DEAD SILENCE, as ghost story-type films tend to prefer atmospherics but it works well here. The use of silence to signal the presence of evil was a fantastic little addition.\\n\\nThe movie has plenty of horror scares: open-caskets, waked out bodies, wide-eyed dolls, cackling old women mixed with thunder and lightning. Mary Shaw in my opinion is one of the best and scariest under appreciated horror icons in modern day horror and I wish they would re-visit this franchise and expand on the universe.\\n\\nI’ve shown DEAD SILENCE to two groups of non-horror fans, and the majority were terrified and claimed it to be one of the scariest movies they’d seen. If you’re a fan of movies that creep you to the bone, you should be more than pleased with this one.\\n\\nI hope this helps you introduce somebody new to the genre we all love and care about so much. If you do watch any of these recommendations, please let me know what you thought.\\n\\nHappy viewing!',\n",

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Over 30 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction in the U.S. Constriction and dilation of the cavernosal vasculature determines penile erection. In the absence of arousal stimuli, activation of heterotrimeric G proteins following ligand binding to membrane receptors maintains constriction of the cavernosal arterioles and sinuses, keeping the penis non-erect. Subsequent to heterotrimeric G protein activation, two signaling pathways are brought into play to cause constriction: the well-characterized Ca2+-dependent pathway (phospholipase C) and the recently identified RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway known as Ca2+ sensitization. The coupling of G protein receptors to phospholipase C activation is well characterized, but much less is known about how RhoA/Rho-kinase is coupled to G protein activation. Recent evidence indicates that the RhoA activation is positively regulated by Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). The regulation of RhoGEF activity is also unclear. Interestingly, one particular RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF is regulated by a proline- rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a Ca2+-dependent enzyme. We have obtained preliminary data to support a role for PYK2 in vascular responses to angiotensin II. We hypothesize that angiotensin II activation of PYK2 and PDZ-RhoGEF leads to increased RhoA/Rho-kinase to maintain the non-erect state. Further, -term over- expression of PYK2 and PDZ-RhoGEF leads to erectile dysfunction. These hypotheses will be tested by 3 specific aims: 1A) to demonstrate that activation of PYK2/PDZ-RhoGEF leads to vasoconstriction and penile flaccidity;1B) to determine if PYK2 expression in the penis can be modulated to alter erectile function and if siRNA for PDZ-RhoGEF will inhibit components of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway;2) to determine if increased PYK2/PDZ-RhoGEF activity contributes to erectile dysfunction in angiotensin II-induced hypertension;and 3) to determine if increased PYK2/PDZ-RhoGEF activity contributes to erectile dysfunction in diabetes. The approach will utilize rat and mouse models of erection. The experiments will determine the biochemical, pharmacological and physiological measures of PYK2/RhoGEF activity with respect to stimulation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway in the intact penis and in isolated cavernosal strips. Gene transfer to over- express PYK2 should lead to a new model of erectile dysfunction whereas;siRNA for PDZ-RhoGEF will reduce signaling via the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway. Contractile force measurements in isolated cavernosal strips (intact and permeabilized) will provide evidence for Ca2+ sensitization and its regulation by PYK2/PDZ- RhoGEF. Erectile dysfunction induced by diabetes and hypertension will be used to evaluate a possible clinical significance of this signaling pathway. PYK2 (-/-) mice will provide an important approach to studying the PYK2/PDZ-RhoGEF signaling pathway. If supported these studies would provide an explanation for the molecular basis for smooth muscle contraction in the normal state and how long-term changes in the penis contribute to erectile dysfunction. The work will provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over 30 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction in the U.S. Whereas, penile erection is determined by cell signaling mechanisms promoting both constriction and dilation of the cavernosal vasculature, current therapeutic approaches focus on stimulating the dilatory response. Our research has identified novel cellular events regulating constrictor responses, and an understanding of how these events can be inhibited will provide an alternative therapeutic approach to treating erectile dysfunction.',\n",

Even if it were true (despite statistically data showing it isnt) men wouldnt gain any benefit. How so? Well if a woman is penalized more and thus disadvantaged for having a tantrum then their female opponent has more of an advantage. On the flip side, if a man is penalized less for having a tantrum and thus gain an advantage, then his male opponent has more of a disadvantage because their opponent wasnt penalized as much as they should have been. In either case there is no net change in advantage, just in the case of women the one receiving the penalizing would be the disadvantaged party and for men the one whose opponent wasnt penalized when they should have been is the disadvantaged party.

       " 'When the WWE announced that Elimination Chamber would take place two weeks after Payback, as a Network exclusive, the decision was met with a flurry of criticism.\\n\\n“Two PPVs in one month? Stupid.”\\n\\n“Why would they do that so close to the June PPV?”\\n\\n“This is ridiculous! There is going to be absolutely no build to any of the matches…”\\n\\nYes, the decision to hold three PPV events in seven weeks may seem like an odd decision at first glance, but the Elimination Chamber has quickly shaped up to be an event that everyone wants to tune into.\\n\\nAll it took was the announcement of a few key matches. The Network exclusive special event suddenly has the internet wrestling community buzzing. The negative mentality surrounding this show has quickly vanished into thin air.\\n\\nThe “no build” comments were unfounded in the first place when you take into account that most of these matches have had months of building, some even longer.\\n\\nThe main event of Dean Ambrose versus Seth Rollins for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship is a prime example of that. Two years in the making, from the inception of The Shield, a three-man wrecking crew that couldn’t be stopped, to the betrayal of Seth Rollins just one year later, the history between Ambrose and Rollins writes this match all on its own. The two former comrades have butted heads since Rollins joined The Authority, and have been in the ring several times already, all of which Rollins got the best of Ambrose.\\n\\nDean Ambrose as a main eventer, for a second straight PPV show? This is something the internet has been begging for. Now you’ve got it, and he is being predominantly featured in episodes of Raw, to the extent that Stone Cold Steve Austin was in 1998. Think about it. Dean is around at the start of the show, featured in segments backstage, wrestles a match, and gets the spotlight in the final portion of Raw. That’s exactly how Austin became such a draw in the Attitude Era. He was the guy that people wanted to see, and the WWE gave them exactly what they wanted. The same can be said about Dean Ambrose.\\n\\nThe two Elimination Chamber matches have peaked the interest of the WWE Universe. For the first time ever, the Tag Team Championships will be defended inside the steel structure, with six teams added to the match. New Day will defend against Tyson Kidd & Cesaro, Prime Time Players, The Ascension, Los Matadores and the Lucha Dragons. All teams have seen action against each other over the last few months. The Ascension put to rest their jobber status by finally picking up a win, New Day beat the Lucha Dragons to earn their shot at the titles which eventually led to them beating Kidd and Cesaro, Los Matadores and Lucha Dragons have battled on a few occasions, and the Prime Time Players… well, they’ve been smack talking everyone. Point is, history is there. The tag team division has received proper build, going back several months.\\n\\nThen there’s the Intercontinental Championship Elimination Chamber match, for the vacant title. Sheamus, Ryback, R-Truth, King Barrett, Rusev and Dolph Ziggler all look to become the next champion. Sheamus, Ziggler and Barrett all have a lengthy list of matches against one another. The notable absences in this match are Neville, who has quite the feud going with Barrett, and Bray Wyatt, who would have been a sight to see inside the structure, and the guy who would want to stop Ryback once again. R-Truth and Rusev seem to have been tossed into the match, but Rusev’s frustrations with his valet Lana have drawn Ziggler into the fold, when Lana placed not one but two kisses on Dolph before an angry Rusev intervened. In terms of pure aggression, there are plenty of big bodies that can cause damage.\\n\\nFinally, there’s John Cena going one-on-one with NXT Champion Kevin Owens, who made a surprise appearance on Raw this week, answering Cena’s open challenge for the United States Championship. While he wasn’t there to fight, Owens had some choice words for the US Champ, going as far as to say that Cena had no right to give him veteran advice because Owens had been wrestling for a longer period of time. The battle of words ended when Kevin Owens delivered a big pop-up powerbomb to John Cena, laying out the champ, and then stomping on the US title. The arrival of the NXT Champion on the main roster was well received across the board, from those who watched on television, to the locker room in the back. Later that night, the announcement was made that Owens would fight Cena at Elimination Chamber in a non-title match.\\n\\nAs part of the NXT roster, and one of the biggest internet darlings out there, the idea of Owens getting a match on a big show, let alone it being his first match up on the main roster, has brought a whole new dynamic to the event. The few matches announced all have a great level of excitement, but when you involve the history of Kevin Owens, and put him opposite of the ring against a man like Cena, you turn your show into a must-see program, and nobody is more excited than Kevin’s son. A young boy who loves Cena, Owen Steen once asked his father during a live event why he wasn’t in the ring with the WWE. When Kevin couldn’t quite answer the question, Owen pondered the idea of his father one day wrestling John Cena.\\n\\nWell, that day has come. Sooner than we all thought.\\n\\nAs a viewer sitting at home, the match of Owens versus Cena alone is worth the $9.99 price of admission. Then, you add the other matches, three championships on the line, and a guaranteed new Intercontinental Champion, and you’ve created an event that nobody should miss out on.',\n",

       " 'Garth Brooks showed Detroit love last weekend when he stopped by Ford Field and performed a high-energy concert in front of 70,000-plus.\\n\\nFor the show, Brooks wore a Barry Sanders No. 20 jersey, in tribute to the legendary Detroit Lions running back and fellow Oklahoma State University alum.\\n\\nBut Barry Sanders played a generation ago. And this happens to be an election season.\\n\\nAnd there happens to be a man named Bernie Sanders among the Democratic candidates for president. And it also happens to be 2020.\\n\\nSo you can imagine the sort of confusion that took place when Brooks posted a photo on his official Instagram account of himself, back turned toward the camera, with \"Sanders\" and \"20\" on the back of his jersey.\\n\\nWhile just about everybody in Michigan knows what the \"Sanders 20\" jersey represents, not everyone outside the state knows about or remembers Sanders\\' greatness on the football field.\\n\\nThat led to comments like these on Brooks\\' Instagram post:\\n\\n• \"Love you, hate the shirt. Trump2020\"\\n\\n• \"Weird. That a millionaire would like a socialist. Hey Garth are you going to distribute your millions?\"\\n\\n• \"Sanders? Really?

       " 'The men stand atop two mutilated Kurdish bodies, one of them holds up his telephone inviting his audience to look at the \"pigs\" he has dominated.\\n\\nHis rugged beard: out of shape, his eyes: hate-filled.\\n\\nHe slowly raises his leg, pauses for milliseconds to gather his rancorous rage, and kicks the semi-detached head of a Kurdish fighter on the hill. \"Allahu Akbar\", his fellow mercenary says, \"this is how you are treated by the Mujahideen,\" he continues.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis video footage was released today on Syrian social media. It is not unique, it is ubiquitous.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the start of the Afrin attacks, which have already claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians, multiple videos of the same nature have been released to the public. The perpetrators are almost always Turkish backed Free Syrian Army affiliates, and sometimes members of the Turkish military. Racism and Islamist supremacy are always overt, whereas sexism is made even more evidently clear when they are mutilating the corpse of a woman fighter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Among hardline Islamists, to call a person a pig is to describe them as a dirty apostate\", Ahmed Shawa, an Arab who works with the left-wing Syrian National Democratic Alliance that is based in Afrin told The Region. \"It is the kind of language that the Islamic State used to use.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe scandalous videos have caused such a headache to Turkish backed opposition, that the so-called \"Ministry of Defence\" of the Syrian Interim Government released a statement with concerns about what it called \"the humanist and ethical military campaign to liberate Afrin from the militias of the PKK/PYD.\" \"We demand a ban on telephone devices, and a ban on carrying personal camera equipment over the course of the military campaign\" the statement they produced reads.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo understand the ways in which war crimes are imbued with racism and sexism, we must return to the eye-opening and vomit-inducing revelations of torture in Abu-Ghraib prison by U.S military personnel stationed in Iraq. The images, released in 2003, showed bodies of men stacked upon each other. They were accompanied by vivid descriptions detailing the sexual abuse of Iraqi men made to feel effeminate. In one scenario, a middle-aged man was forced to wear woman\\'s underwear, and as his abuser asked him if he was a \"faggot\", the man responded that he was only being forced to wear the garments imposed by his very captor.\\n\\nIn another scenario, women prison guards -- collaborators in the misogynistic, nationalist, and racist spectacle of American empire that was Abu-Ghraib -- would use red dye to make the men feel like their bodies were covered in menstrual blood. The goal, as Professor Johanna Bond has noted, was to \"feminize the \"Arab\" enemy\".\\n\\n\\n\\nToday, when the scales have been tipped, many of the Arab men enlisted in the Turkish backed Free Syrian army seek to do the same to the Kurds of Afrin.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just like the women of Abu-Ghraib, so too do the Kurds have their own collaborators, including village guards and soldiers helping to invade Afrin. In one video recorded in social media, a man who is possibly of Kurdish origin punches and kicks an old shepherd, demanding he reveals the whereabouts of a secret armoury owned by the YPG. In a gesture that can be regarded as nothing but hyper-masculinist, he smokes a cigarette seemingly unfazed by an old, grey-haired Kurdish man pleading for his life. The soldier of the Turkish armed forces, who communicates to the man in Kurmanji, eventually sends the man to the clutches of Turkish backed FSA.\\n\\n\\n\\nUndignified, without honour, unclean, these and various other epithets have been hurled at the pale, immobile, dead bodies of Kurdish fighters. In one video, a fighter who has been reportedly identified as Ahmad M. Hanan, according to Journalist Mutlu Civiroglu, is surrounded by a mob of Jihadists, chanting \"Allahu Akbar\". The voice of a man, or possibly boy, taking the video is pubescent. \"You pig, you dog\" people scream as they take turns to kick his head, \"Your sisters Vagina\" they scream. To underscore the point \"Your sister\\'s vagina, and your honour\" they shriek to a body unable to receive their racist rage.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a way, its strange, the violent expressions of these jihadists regularly alternate between manifestations of religious piety and racist rage. \"You pig, you dog\", they say, before screaming \"Allahu Akbar\". \"Your sister\\'s vagina ... by the grace of god\" they chant with no self-awareness whatsoever to the religious precepts banning such behaviour.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the Turkish backed FSA fighter, the Kurd is a pig, the Kurd is a dog, the Kurd needs to be conquered. \"We will conquer the Kurds a manifest conquering,\" says a battalion, referencing a Quran verse on their way to what will most likely be a bloodbath. The civilian is the enemy: \"those who flee are in danger because they are PKK. When 15 tried to escape from us, we suspected they were PKK\" said an older figure in another video. Then there was the \"liberation of Qasal village\", at least according to the mercenaries celebrating their occupation of a majority Kurdish village, \"These are the shops of the pigs .. these are the shops of the Kako and Kako [racist term to refer to Kurds]\".\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat has disturbed most is how this very racist rage is projected onto the body of the dead Kurdish woman. In a video that has drawn the outrage of the world, a dead female Kurdish fighter in the YPJ (women\\'s protection units), is viciously attacked by a litany of brutal kicks on her mutilated body. Parts of her torso were dismembered from the rest of her body. One fighter approaches the body to pose for the camera, another two men debate on her beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She is beautiful man..\" announces one man to his fellow soldier.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mutilated Kurdish woman is also not just a pig, according to the so-called FSA fighters, but a \"female pig\", a woman who deserves to have her breasts stomped on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is our spoil of war from the female pigs of the PKK\" one of the men howls.\\n\\n\\n\\nMisogyny, Islamist supremacy, and racism -- these are the drivers of the Turkish military and its FSA forces in the drive to ethnically cleanse Afrin. Operation Olive Branch at its very root is an assault on the Kurdish woman, because it is the Kurdish woman who represents everything they hate most.',\n",

       " 'Wherever I go in the world, people ask me about ISIS. And I advise them to ignore the endless debates about the peaceful versus violent nature of Islam and take a long, hard look at the Islamic State. ISIS is Islam, exposed in all its cruelty and ugliness, unchanged since Muhammad.\\n\\nThe atrocities committed by ISIS are merely an extension of the atrocities committed by Islam’s prophet.\\n\\nThe true Five Pillars of Islam are: Slaughter, Intolerance, Oppression, Hatred, and Global Dominion, because Muhammad was a slaughterer, intolerant, oppressive, hateful, and drove his armies to destroy everything and everyone that stood in the way of his establishment of a world caliphate.\\n\\nMuhammad said to the people of Mecca, “I have brought slaughter to you,” then he beheaded every Jewish male, young and old.\\n\\nISIS immolated Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, because Muhammad burned people alive.\\n\\nWhen the leader of the Jewish Bani al-Nadir tribe refused to reveal the location of his tribe’s treasures, Muhammad ordered his soldiers to “Torture him until you extract what he has.” So a fire was built on the chest of Kinanah bin al-Rabi. Again, when some of his men resisted Muhammad’s planned attack against the Byzantines at Tabuk, the prophet commanded that they be burned alive in the house where they were meeting.\\n\\nISIS enslaves and rapes women because Muhammad did, even when he took a six-year-old little girl as his wife and consummated their union when she turned nine.\\n\\nISIS mutilates and crucifies men, women, and children because its prophet did. When ISIS hurled a homosexual man from a tower, and the crowd waiting below stoned him to death after they saw that he had survived, they were only following the example of their prophet who stoned homosexuals.\\n\\nThe only difference between 1,400 years of slaughter by Muslims, who follow the practices of Muhammad, and the carnage carried out today by ISIS is that today’s atrocities are broadcast throughout the world by social media.\\n\\nUnexpectedly, social media has also made ISIS a blessing to the Muslim world, enabling Muslims to see the true face of Islam.\\n\\nHatred is what your religion requires of you, not just ritual washings. Slaughter is what your prophet demands of you, not just daily prayers. To follow Islam is to commit your life to jihad, to the destruction or subjugation of all non-Muslims in the name of the god of Islam.\\n\\nBut thanks to ISIS, you can free yourself from the lies of Hezbollah, Hamas, and Al-Jazeera, if you have the courage. They cannot protect you from a western conspiracy, because there is none. Your enemy is Islam, not America.\\n\\nWhen you recognize that ISIS is Islam, you free yourself from the naiveté of world leaders who tell you that ISIS is an anomaly of Islam, leaders that, I am sorry to say, include US President Barack Obama, who told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria recently that, “There is an element growing out of Muslim communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion, have embraced a nihilistic, violent, almost medieval interpretation of Islam.”\\n\\nBut it is those who deny that Islam is “nihilistic, violent, almost medieval” who have perverted the religion.\\n\\nISIS is Islam. Religion by the sword. Religion by intolerance and violence. Religion commanded by its prophet to conquer the world, behead apostates, mutilate thieves, crucify nonmuslims, and stone everyone that engages in sexual relations that disagree with Muslim laws and practices.\\n\\nISIS has torn the mask from Islam, giving the Muslim world a choice for the first time in fourteen centuries.\\n\\nChoose Islam, and you choose ISIS, because they are indistinguishable. Reject ISIS, and you reject Islam, because they are one.\\n\\nISIS must be stopped, yes. It is a threat to every nation’s security. More than that, it is a threat to the evolution of human consciousness. But it is not the sole problem of America and the West. It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of Muslims and Arabs. And the armies of Jordan, Egypt, UAE, and others are well equipped to deal with it. Western intervention will only create more chaos and reinforce the illusion of a Middle East/Western conflict.\\n\\nLike Libya and Yemen, ISIS is a tribal conflict, not a political one. The Islamic State is the Sunni backlash against domination and persecution by minority Shi’a Muslims in Iraq and the ruling Alawite minority of Syria.\\n\\nIslam hates everything that is not Islam. And just as fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring, love and goodness cannot flow from a religion that is established on hatred and violence.\\n\\nAs long as Muslims refuse to take a strong and aggressive stand against terrorism, they must share responsibility for the continuing atrocities. The hour has come for every Muslim to choose to be human or inhuman, noble or criminal.',\n",

Everything that DEFILED LIGHT releases is uncut FILTH!\\n\\nPerverse Homage to the Rotting Divine by Orgy of Carrion\\n\\nNINE – FALSE Untitled\\n\\nFirst off, I feel it’s worth mentioning that I’ve been a fan of extreme music for close to twenty years now. Not meaning to drop that as a scene credit point, but more just a testament to the fact that I breath, eat and shit this vast sub-culture up. I’ve grown up alongside it and the music has been the soundtrack to my life. I’m into just about every genre under the sun, but what really makes my mouth water these days is bands that go above and beyond the typical format and length that most projects ascribe to. Anyone can theoretically pick up an instrument and create a thirty second grindcore song or twenty minutes of feedback-based doom. But what really makes an album stand out is if it’s permeated with depth and allows one to completely immerse themselves in a band’s sound, which False have unequivocally done with this album. Unholy church choir synthesizers and keyboards? Check. Blast Beats? Check. Guitar melodies ridden with venom and pestilence? Check. Even with those requirements met, False have still conjured something darkly unique from the depths of their collective, blackened soul. This is an album that has a vast scope contained within each song. With five tracks composing this savage declaration of war, you’d best hire a fucking Sherpa to ascend to the darkened summit this band has created, because this is an album that has a number of highs and lows throughout it, not only due to the duration of each track, but also the texture contained within and the thought behind every moment False has created.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nUntitled (2015) by False\\n\\nEIGHT – BARGHEST Into Weeping Firmament\\n\\nBarghest’s newest release, the three song EP Into Weeping Firmament, is a quick foray into the annals of history, with a bit of modern spite. Despite a lineup change since their last scorching release, the Louisianian quartet continues to bring the spite, excelling at the execution of their simple formula. Infectious riffs, pounding drums, snarled vocals, and a lot of burning hate make up the core of this album. From the aesthetics of the artwork, the sound of the band itself and even the track names, this group exudes early low-fi black metal worship. While many bands try and re-capture the early primitive hate that made the bands of yore so beloved, many only succeed in making pieces that are shadows of the original style, but Barghest successfully channels the hate and agony of bands like early Bathory and Burzum while still bringing in new elements of originality to make a truly enjoyable listen.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nInto Weeping Firmament by Barghest\\n\\nSEVEN – LUBBERT DAS Deluge\\n\\nStop whatever you are doing and listen to some of the raddest black metal you will hear this month, brought to by LUBBERT DAS. This band has created a tape that is a must hear for any elite black metal fan that loves it when bands push the genre forward. LUBBERT DAS is on my radar now, and has earned a spot on our end of the year list for top black metal releases! The emotions that this band evokes is so pure that I have not been able to stop listening to this release. I have a feeling that after you press play below you just might feel the same way! LUBBERT DAS is the kind of band that makes what we do so much fun.\\n\\nDeluge by Lubbert Das\\n\\nSIX – VANUM Realm of Sacrifice\\n\\nDespite having worked closely together in the past, Vanum represents the first pairing of the duo for a shared project; a pairing that – judging by the quality of this release – was clearly overdue. Referencing obvious comparison points such as Morgan’s and Rekevics’ other bands, or perhaps even prominent subgenre buddies such as Wolves in the Throne Room, would be lackadaisical at best and would wholly fail to describe Vanum’s introspective sound and distinctive character. Whether through thoughtfully crafted repetition or through flagrant variations in tempo, the four lengthy compositions that make up Realm of Sacrifice revolve around wonderfully uneasy melancholia and a slow-fast dynamic that erupts from near-silence to a whirlwind of raw and unhallowed black metal in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nRealm Of Sacrifice by VANUM\\n\\n\\n\\nFIVE – SERPENTS LAIR Circumambulating the Stillborn\\n\\nThe songs don’t particularly sound catchy and that’s not to say that the album features a lot of dissonance. Mostly, they don’t come across as catchy because the songs wind down epic runtimes evolving from start to finish. Serpents Lair don’t repeat many riffs. The songs morph from one riff to the next. The best aspect of that approach is that you never think you’re listening to the same songs no matter how many times you play them. The repeat listens can last forever, and you will always notice an interesting riff or song segment that you may have overlooked before.\\n\\nThis is a proper full-length, as noted earlier, and most of the runtimes last five to eight minutes. The musicianship is great, as the riffs are played well, the vocals feature some range of styles, and the drumming keeps pace without being overdone.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nCircumambulating the Stillborn by Serpents Lair\\n\\nFOUR – AKHLYS The Dreaming I\\n\\nAkhlys features none other than Nightbringer mastermind Naas Alcameth. The riffs on The Dreaming I swirl around almost Mitochondrion style, touched by black metal iciness and straight one-armed snare drum blasts. Akhlys features some of Alcameth’s style similar with Nightbringer, using dense, high-speed tremolo-riffing and occasional ritualistic passages. The vocals are high-pitched and the guitars use obscure melodic leads to haunting effect. The Dreaming I almost sounds like a soundtrack piece to compliment some of the theme and lyrics, which involves an exploration into dreams. This aspect helps it win favor easily, as the content and imagery conjured by the music helps pique the listener’s interest. If you liked Alcameth’s work with Nightbringer, particularly manifested in Nightbringer’s latest full-length release, Ego Dominuus Tuus, you will love The Dreaming I.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nThe Dreaming I by AKHLYS\\n\\nTHREE – MISÞYRMING Söngvar elds og óreiðu\\n\\nOh, shackle the devil already! What is this refined black metal art doing toiling in the bowels of obscurity? Fallen Empire Records proudly presents us this band with the letter from God-knows-what alphabet.\\n\\nNo, really f*ckers, if you want refined, textured, intelligent black metal art, start here on Mispyrming’s Söngvar elds og óreiðu. It’s intense, and somewhat chaotic on occasion, like a maelstrom devouring fishing vessels on the sea into deep dark chasms where no life can exist. It is also, however, beautiful and resplendent to the ears. The songwriting shines on such majestic pieces as “Songur uppljomunar,” for one. This isn’t some album comprised of blasting from end-to-end with no arrangements. Each track devotes a riff to each section that is precise in a way that few black metal bands can muster for full-length releases.\\n\\nWhat’s more is that this band hails from Reykjavik, Iceland, home to bands Sinmara and Svartidaudi. Some of the aforementioned bands might be members of this band and other projects from Iceland. The scene there is quite small, but features an extremely talented nucleus of musicians.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\n<a href=”http://misthyrming.bandcamp.com/album/s-ngvar-elds-og-rei-u”>Söngvar elds og óreiðu by Misþyrming</a>\\n\\nTWO – WIEGEDOOD De Doden Hebben het Goed\\n\\nWhen Gilles Demolder (Oathbreaker), Wim (Rise and Fall) and Levy Seynaeve (Amenra, Hessian) decided to collaborate on a new project, the product of their union was never going to sit quietly at the back of the room; the common denominator here being the undulating, blighted aural landscapes fashioned by these already-established acts, each carving their unique perspective upon the scorched earth with harsh and unforgiving hands. Wiegedood (Dutch for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is a name that evokes incredibly powerful imagery, yet the unmitigated powerlessness implied by such a word becomes the foundation of the band’s sound; a broiling mass of hopelessness and disconsolation that is incredibly naturalistic and equally austere, creating an immersive wave of cold, atmospheric black metal that is more frequently associated with the Pacific Northwest and yet fundamentally rooted within Europe’s finest.\\n\\nThey may be an entity devoid of the intrinsic characteristics of their other projects, yet the black sun of Amenra casts its baleful shadow tenuously over De Doden Hebben het Goed; the downtrodden fury of opener ‘Svanesang’ as thick and impenetrable as much as it is breathtakingly paced, and even when the landscape becomes a place of near silence – a lonesome, mournful guitar note the only thing to break the uneasy silence – the atmosphere still speaks of desolation and futility that is as provocative as it is crippling.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\nDe Doden Hebben Het Goed by Wiegedood\\n\\nONE – LEVIATHAN Scar Sighted\\n\\nOnward with what is most important here: the music, which is something that is the only and invincible protagonist of this album, and the only thing that really matters in this smoldering pile of bile-drenched sonic wretchedness. As previously mentioned, with Scar Sighted Wrest is back at what he does best and at what we have all fallen in love with him for over the years: creating deformities in our minds that are so out there and so fucked, that you wonder how on earth your ears are even hearing such a barrage of disfigured and mutilating hatred. Many staple elements of Leviathan’s sound remain, but also, much has changed. Wrest’s demonic and robotic vocal meanderings remain, and they are the shit of the most horrifying horror movies. Vocals so out there and ruined and drenched in torment that you can’t even decipher what orifice of his body they came out of, possibly a gaping wound in his throat with a mic in it, shoved all the way down his windpipe. The guitar work is immense, and reminds us once again, who, along with Deathspell Omega, invented this wretched and disembodied way of being so awesomely anti-musical, and was one of the first people to use dissonance, atonality and completely anti-musical notes to sculpt riffs and solos that wind and twist like a daunting hallucination.\\n\\nRead the full review HERE…\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Blasts from the past!\\n\\nFrom the 1986 Cherry Orchard Studios session in Croydon, our first recording as Official Secrets. Apart from vocals and the odd solo, these tracks were recorded live. I remember two things about these sessions.\\n\\nFirstly The engineer thought we hadn’t left enough time for vocals but I assured him that Rob and Pete would be fine with a handful of takes. I remember his surprise as they put their vocals down perfectly within around 20 minutes! Ha!\\n\\nSecondly, we did the final mixdown in a very small control room eating Doner Kebabs - that place must have stunk for years!\\n\\nAll your promises was one of the best songs we ever did - I still love it and I don’t think any of the recordings ever sounded fresher than the two on this session. Rob wrote a great deal of the music - Brian may have helped on the lyrics. Catch Rob’s superb riff leading into each verse, Brian’s funky lick on the link and Pete’s slinky walking bassline played on an original Hofner Violin Bass - marvellous stuff!\\n\\nThe weaker of the two songs by a fair bit with lyrics co-composed by Rob and Brian, hence the complete lack of meaning - I think they were writing about different subjects! My ‘eighties’ keyboard playing (note original Fender Rhodes electric piano - weighed 2 tons - sounded like a bag of shit!) dates the song terribly! Paul’s drumming though is remarkably crisp and salvages the song. I think Brian wrote the music - sorry Brian!\\n\\nThis was a bloody ridiculous session, in 1987 I think. Recorded in a split level studio in Acton, the song was massively computer sequenced (as was the fashion in those days) and the stuttering sampled vocal intro is unforgiveable! Paul only played hi-hat, cymbals and snare while the sequencer handled kick drum - he did a fantastic job and I am amazed he didn’t just tell me to **** off! A complaint levelled at me was that in the final mix, no bass or guitar is audible - quite true, except for the solo which Brian played through a Marshall stack at such painful volume that we could feel the control room floor vibrating. The snare sound is a multiple sample of many great snare sounds which together sound like someone hitting a full dustbin. The tambourine at the beginning is me and if you can bother to wait for the vocals to come in, the song has some charm other than the lyrics which were some uncontrolled, inarticulate rant about an ex-girlfriend whose name escapes me! We recorded one song in 12 hours - it’s taken until now for me to want to hear it again!\\n\\nRecorded in JB Studios in Bromley (Homesdale Road if anyone’s interested!) this was an awful session. We made the drastic mistake of putting all the parts down separately which took twice as long and sounded drab. Between takes, anyone not playing went to the Homesdale Arms and had a skinfull. The drum sound is astounding on this track particularly - those are supposed to be tom-toms - they sound like packing cases. It is however a catchy tune and typical of Rob who was a gifted songwriter. I do the most awful synth solo for which I should be shot.\\n\\n“What’s this song called?” yelled the engineer, ink marker in hand, about to scrawl on the finished master tape reel. I didn’t have a title so I just said “I forget” - hence the name! The other song to be recorded at JB Studios in Bromley, it was another “**** you” rant lyrics about some girlfriend or other - utter doggerel. The music was inspired by seeing Alison Moyet on The Tube singing a superb version of ‘Try a Little Tenderness’ so I wrote a slow blues sequence which speeded up to this slightly clattering song. Rob’s vocal is excellent, as is his guitar solo in the slow middle section. I still think it could have been a good song with a bit of work.\\n\\nAgain Rob demonstrates his superb ear for a tune and I demonstrate a complete lack of taste with the arrangement! Paul was not involved on this as it was recorded in Pete’s bedroom using a drum machine. I like the song, can’t bear the production but yet again a lovely solo from Rob saves the day in the middle. Actually I quite like the percussion-laden atmospheric ending - dated but nice.',\n",

       " 'Feb. 25, 2013\\x97 -- Jurors listening to the Jodi Arias\\' murder trial -- which already includes an admitted killing, confessed lies, kinky sex and nude photos -- heard another stunning allegation when the prosecution claimed that Arias sent a coded message from her jail cell in an attempt to tamper with a witness.\\n\\nProsecutor Juan Martinez delivered the bombshell during cross examination before the court halted for the weekend on Thursday, revealing two magazines that allegedly contained secret coded messages written by Arias.\\n\\nArias, 32, is on trial in Phoenix, Ariz., for allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008.\\n\\nCatching Up on the Trial? Check Out ABC News\\' Jodi Arias Trial Coverage\\n\\nThe two magazines -- an issue of Star (ironically with a cover story about Casey Anthony, to whom Arias has been compared) and an issue of Digital Photo Pro -- were intercepted by guards in August 2011 at the Estrella jail in Phoenix. Arias had intended for the two items to be handed over to Ann Campbell, a friend who has been a constant supporter and has visited Arias in jail every week, the prosecutor said.\\n\\nMartinez did not reveal in court why the items drew suspicion, but at some point someone noticed the small, faint notes written in pencil in the margins.\\n\\nLike something out of a spy novel, Martinez laid out for jurors what he believes is evidence of Arias\\' attempt to manipulate the testimony of a witness.\\n\\nIn the Star Magazine at the bottom of one page was the following set of numbers: 43 40 56 20 37 54. Each number, the prosecutor said, corresponded to a page from the Digital Photo Pro magazine which contained a part of the message.\\n\\nStrung together, the entire message, according to Martinez, read, \"You f***ed up what you told my attorney the next day / directly contradicts what I\\'ve been saying for over a year / get down here ASAP and see me before you talk to them again and before / you testify so / we can fix this / interview was excellent! Must talk ASAP!\"\\n\\nThe intended recipient of the message remains unclear. However, based on court documents, the magazines were intercepted just a few weeks after the prosecution interviewed Arias\\' ex-boyfriend, Matthew McCartney, and just four days before a pre-trial hearing.\\n\\n\"You tried to get someone to lie at that hearing, didn\\'t you?\" Martinez asked Arias on the stand. \"No,\" she replied.\\n\\nBased on Martinez\\' line of questioning Thursday, it was clear the fiery prosecutor was trying to draw a link between the possible witness tampering and Arias\\' allegation that Alexander was sexually attracted to young boys.\\n\\nArias\\' claim that Alexander liked young boys bolsters the defense\\' case -- that Travis was a sexual deviant who was making increasingly abusive demands on Arias along with growing threats of violence. She claims she was forced to kill Alexander in self defense when he threatened to kill her.\\n\\nThe prosecution is hoping to convince the jury that the inflammatory testimony about pedophilia is just another one of Arias\\' lies.\\n\\nArias has admitted lying when she initially told police that she was not at Alexander\\'s Mesa, Ariz., home when he was killed and lied again when she changed her story to say that a masked couple invaded Alexander\\'s house and killed him. She claimed she lied out of shame for her actions.\\n\\nWhile a jury might make allowances for lying in the immediate aftermath of the killing, the coded messages, if believed, indicate deception three years after the crime and could be damaging to Arias\\' defense.\\n\\nArias could face the death penalty if a jury convicts her of first-degree murder.\\n\\nThe prosecutor is expected to continue his cross-examination this morning when trial resumes for the eighth week.',\n",

       " 'In the tradition of the Jap, the Nigger, the Hun and the Chink, the American media and propaganda machine has now produced the “Arab” — a caricature, a falsehood, but universally hated. There is, of course, nothing redeeming about the Arab at all. He is a rat, vermin, just like the Jap. He is dumb like the Nigger. He is evil like the Hun and shifty like the Chink. Worst of all for this horrible Arab, you know in your heart that he is the child of a lesser God, not your God. No wonder you hate him so!\\n\\nI know how this feels. I was beaten up at school every day beginning at age five because I was the half-breed son of a Chink and a Hun. Parents threatened me because of what this little half-breed was supposed to have done to their spouses or brothers or fathers in Vietnam or in World War II. As long as life here isn’t safe for the Arab, it won’t be safe for me and the other Chinks, Huns, Japs and Niggers. I need to get out of this country. Since September 11th, it’s making me crazy, absolutely unbalanced, just to be in the company of all these hateful, selfish, spiteful, self-righteous people who call themselves Americans.\\n\\nSome of you really should know better, too. After all, some of you are Kikes. If this Chink-Hun can understand why it’s bad to hate an Arab just because he’s an Arab, why can’t a Kike — who’s grandparents were tortured in the evil of the concentration camps — figure it out? Are memories really that short? Is humanity really that limited?\\n\\nMaybe if I go to Germany or China or the middle east (so many people these days seem to think I look Arabic — imagine that), I’ll be accepted and not one of the hunted. But probably not. Maybe the world is only safe for bleach-white non-Germanic protestants.',\n",

At least, that's what it's supposed to do.  Unfortunately the social studies departments at UH Manoa are little more than propaganda factories brainwashing students with specific viewpoints that are far to the left politically and philosophically.  UH rightfully prides itself on its diversity of races and cultures among students and faculty.  But it has a terrible lack of diversity in viewpoints presented to the students on topics such as the history of Hawaii and whether we should be proud to be Americans.  A forum on a controversial topic should feature several professors with strongly differing views engaging in robust debate.

       " 'The Left’s stance on provocative art is inconsistent.\\n\\nWhy aren’t liberals offering Pamela Geller a federal subsidy? Geller is the blogger-activist who organized the “Draw Muhammad” exhibition in Garland, Texas, which inspired some DIY jihadists to attack the event. The would-be terrorists chose poorly: They were cut down by Texas lawmen shortly after wounding a security guard.\\n\\nLet’s hop in the WayBack Machine for a moment.\\n\\n\\nIn 1986, the National Endowment of Arts paid about $20,000 for Andreas Serrano’s “Piss Christ.” Serrano peed in a glass, plunked a plastic icon of Jesus on the cross into it, and then snapped a picture. I will say the lighting was lovely. But, as strange as it seemed to the “arts community,” some people were offended.\\n\\nRELATED: Islam and Free Speech: Missing the Point in Garland\\n\\nIn 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art agreed to host a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit. Mapplethorpe’s work was edgy, particularly going by the attitudes at the time. There were the obligatory sexual bondage scenes, urine-drinking (artistic urine: is there anything it can’t do?), and, of course, his most famous work: a self-portrait showing a bullwhip going someplace the sun reportedly does not shine.\\n\\n\\nMany social conservatives flipped out. They asked: “Why the hell are we paying for this?!”\\n\\nNow, personally, I think this is a reasonable question even if you are a huge fan of Mapplethorpe’s hide-the-bullwhip oeuvre or enjoy seeing the Christian God incarnate lose in the urine dunk tank.\\n\\n\\nRELATED: Americans Have a Right to Insult Islam\\n\\nFederal subsidies for “art” — or even art without scare quotes — are legitimately controversial for all sorts of reasons: Surely the government has higher priorities; bureaucrats shouldn’t be in the business of picking winners and losers, in the marketplace or the art gallery; it’s particularly annoying to be asked to fund expression you find inartistic and obscene.\\n\\nThomas Jefferson said it well: “To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.”\\n\\n\\nBut whenever Congress attempted to curtail funding of offensive art, editorial pages, faculty lounges, and museum boards launched a nationwide elite freak-out. In 1989, when the Senate voted to restrict some funding for offensive art, Richard Koshalek, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, told the New York Times that he felt that the vote was “a form of psychological tyranny, trying to put the art world into a state of terror.” Painter Robert Motherwell exclaimed that “for Congress to act as censor is outrageous. The ultimate end is fascism.”\\n\\nRELATED: Affronts to Religion in Our Age of Reason\\n\\nWhenever Congress attempted to curtail funding of offensive art, editorial pages, faculty lounges, and museum boards launched a nationwide elite freak-out.\\n\\nSimilar reactions sprouted up like mushrooms on manure throughout the 1990s. For instance, in 1997, the Miami Herald editorialized that having a legal standard of “decency and respect” for arts funding was a possible invitation for the Supreme Court to “scuttle the First Amendment.”\\n\\nSpeaking of manure, there was the time the taxpayer-subsidized Brooklyn Museum of Art ran an exhibit in which a portrait of the Virgin Mary was partly made of pornographic pictures and elephant dung — because, you know, art.\\n\\n\\nRELATED: American Speech Law Is Exceptional\\n\\nNote: None of the critics said such work should be banned. They said it shouldn’t be publicly showcased on their dime. And yet, opposition to a taxpayer subsidy was almost universally seen as unambiguous censorship and violence against the First Amendment.\\n\\nAnother interesting tidbit: Christians didn’t try to murder these artists. Nor did Christian organizations exhort their members to do so.\\n\\n#related#Which brings us to Pamela Geller. I’m consistent: I didn’t like “Piss Christ,” and I don’t like insulting drawings of Mohammed. If Geller wanted an NEA grant to dunk Mohammed in beautifully illuminated urine, I would disagree quite strongly.\\n\\nBut that’s not what she’s doing. She’s contending that in America, people are allowed to say offensive things without risking execution. I am at a loss as to why anyone would disagree with that. But I am utterly baffled how people who think it’s censorship to withdraw funding for anti-Christian “hate speech” can argue that private individuals have no right to express anti-Muslim views.\\n\\n“While we have freedom of speech,” a New York Daily News columnist insisted, “we also have freedom of religion, which shouldn’t be impinged upon.” CNN’s Chris Cuomo, a law-school grad, tweeted that Geller’s “hate speech” isn’t protected by the Constitution. At first Cuomo suggested proof of this could be found in the Constitution itself. He then hastily clarified that it fails the “fighting words” doctrine of the Supreme Court.\\n\\n\\nI’m dubious about that. But if he’s right, the lesson is clear: Violence pays. I doubt that’s what he intended to say. But what do I know? I think these people are nuts.',\n",

       " 'Greece, home of Athens. Everyone says yougotta go there. I’ll be honest though. I was notimpressed. That place is run down. All theirbuildings are falling apart. I think Athens is theDetroit of Europe. There is an economic crisisincredibly relevant in our world today, and no cityhas been hit harder than Athens. Sections of the cityare literally in ruins. Many of the homes I sawhardly had walls, let alone, ceilings or mailboxes.\\n\\nGreece also contains the storied land of Olympia, birthplace of the Olympics. The Olympics originated as a religious ceremony. It was a way of worshiping the gods. I think I’d probably make church more often if I got to throw javelins throughout the service. Olympia is where the first field, track, and trampolining events wereever held. In fact just past an ancient archway near the historic greek arena, you can see the spot where the first olympic athlete to ever shoot up steroids took place. The first olympic athletes competed completely naked. I think that would make the relay race baton pass a little more interesting. Runner running, reaching back for the baton: That’s not it. That’s not it. That’s still not it. Geez, I think I’m in a relationship now.Greece sure doesn’t win as many events as they use to. In the beginning it was:\\n\\nGREECE WITH THE GOLD!!!ANDGREECE WITH THE SILVER!!!ANDGREECE WITH THE BRONZE!!!GREECE HAS ONCE AGAIN SWEPT EVERY EVENT.\\n\\nnow its\\n\\nGREECE, UMM, I GUESS YOU CAN COME WATCH IF YOU WANT. OR, I DON\\'T KNOW, DO HAVE A GUY WHO SWIMS OR SOMETHING. HOW ABOUT THIS, WE’LL LET ONE OF YOUR GUYS PLAY SWIMMING? IS THAT OKAY? THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OLYMPICS. NOW SCRAM!!\\n\\nWatching an event that unites the world, on a cruise ship that has an international crew, was a unique experience. Although nothing makes me feel like more of a complete piece of shit than watching the olympics. Every athlete has overcome such adversity to make it to where they are. The back stories they do on each athlete get me every time.\\n\\nKim Sung was driving home from a practice late a night five years ago. His land was being hit by the worst storm in its small nations recorded history. Kim could hardly see the road on account of all the rain, snow, sleet, hail, wind, lightning, tornados and earthquakes. Kim was only a block away from his home, when suddenly, outof no where. His head exploded. Doctors said that he would never live again.But he proved them wrong. Now, Kim Sung wakes up every day at three in the morning, and runs 400 miles, just to get to the training center, that he built, out of nothing but pine cones and a love he has for a family he’ll never know.\\n\\nGenerally Im watching this while half asleep on the couch in nothing but my socks and underwear, and a dap of nacho cheese that has dried on my belly.\\n\\nSantarini is Greek island that was once a great volcano. The majority of which has long since submerged underwater. Thousands of years of once flowing lava and volcanic rock have caused many of it’s beaches to be made up completely of black sand. To the south one beach is actually made up of red sand. Sandwiched in between these two anomalies of ocean front real estate, situated high on top of a mountain, sits the ancient city of Theos. Long since abandoned, archeologists have uncovered a relatively well preserved city for as old as it is (Athens, what’s your excuse?) As you walk through the site, you can really get a sense of what it was like to live in a town during 200 - 300 b.c.. Their main street leads you pass their theater which sits right across from the town bath house. Just like today. Separate from the bathhouse would be the town toilet. A large open air room, with holes in concrete benches that lined its four walls. This is where say tired toilet jokes to each other like, “You don’t buy mead, you just rent it” or “Man, I got to pee like a racepegasaus”\\n\\nSometimes in the center of the room they would have a small pond filled with frogs. With often a street filled with people on the other side of the roofless bathroom walls, the croaking of the frogs would conceal the bathroom noises. Inspired by this I’ve taken to carrying around a frog with me to mask the breaking of my wind. I’ve found that timing the passing of gas with the ’Ribbits’ of pocket frogs is generally more socially awkward that just simply being civilized.\\n\\nOne street was lined with living quarters of the Greeks residents. I assumed people moved back then. You live in Theos, but you think your business that details chariots might do a little better in Mykenos. So what happens to your apartment? Meanwhile a kid up the island wants to move out of his parents cave. Sure, he could build his own stone one bedroom apartment. But why not check at the pad of that guy who recently got fed to the lions. Were there landlords back then, showing places around?\\n\\n\"So this is it.

       " 'Could it be true? That’s what John Ray, attorney for Shannan Gilbert’s family, is suggesting. In an explosive news conference on Thursday, Ray brought forth a Long Island escort named “Leanne” who claims about a year after Gilbert went missing, she was roughed up in a sexual encounter with former Suffolk Police Chief James Burke in an Oak Beach house party where alcohol and cocaine were prevalent. Leanne claims Burke choked her and forced her into oral sex after calling her a “not a good whore” and paying her for her services in 2011, just months before he assumed the role of police chief. Leanne also claims to have had several other Suffolk County police officers as clients and offered to take a lie detector test to back up her story.\\n\\n\\n\\nJames Burke, as we all know, is now serving out a 46-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to beating a man in custody who stole a duffel bag filled with sex toys and pornography out of his SUV and then conspiring with officers to cover up his actions. He also is reported to have refused help from the FBI to work the LISK case, an act that makes many suspicious of what he might have been hiding.\\n\\nIn his press conference yesterday, John Ray said Leanne’s account, “brings a direct connection between Burke and those poor dead victims lying along Ocean Parkway.” When asked if he was “outright accusing Jimmy Burke of possibly being the Gilgo Beach serial killer,” Ray answered quickly and calmly, “Yes,” and further explained that he believes it is possible Burke and Dr. Peter Hackett could have worked together to murder and dispose of the victims along Gilgo Beach. Guys, I am telling you this is an OUTRAGEOUS claim. Look, I’m not saying he isn’t on to something here–but the fact that this guy just called a press conference basically accusing the former chief of police of being a serial killer? That’s not something you see every day. You can watch the full press conference here (and I do recommend watching the entire thing):\\n\\n\\n\\nI’d like to make it known that James Burke’s attorney, Joseph Conway, was quick to dismiss the claims as made at the press conference “completely outrageous.” Additionally, John Ray claimed he hasn’t taken any of this to the FBI or authorities yet, though he plans to.\\n\\nNow, I don’t really know what to make of all this. Honestly, I don’t even know where to start. I’m pretty much blown away by all this. Many have long suspected that when the DA’s office refused help from the FBI on the LISK case, Burke was the reason behind that. Maybe he was afraid the FBI would uncover his private life was intertwined with the escort scene on Gilgo Beach. Or maybe it was something even more sinister than that. Whatever the reason, I do feel like everyone needs to be investigated to the fullest extent in this case, no matter how small the lead or outrageous the claims might seem.\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter and on Facebook.

       " 'Here’s a quick quiz for you to take. Answer the following questions. Be as honest as possible:\\n\\nDo you feel that people often don’t (or can’t) understand you or your problems? Do you feel that there are many barriers in your life which you have no control over? Do you often ask for help from others and/or feel like few people are willing to help you? Do you feel like you often don’t receive the attention or appreciation that you deserve? Do people often complain that you don’t listen to them, when in fact, you feel like they don’t listen to you? Do you feel like most other people have lives that are much easier than yours? Do you fight with close friends and loved ones often? If so, is it usually their fault? Do people suddenly drop contact with you with no explanation and refuse to communicate with you again? Do you often feel helpless, like you have little opportunity to improve your life?\\n\\nIf you answered “yes” to more than half of the questions above, then please read this post carefully. It could very well be the first step to turning all of the above problems around. Parts of this article may not be easy to read. But I implore you to keep an open mind and take it seriously.\\n\\nIf you did answer “yes” to at least half of the above questions, chances are you are an emotional vampire. Don’t take that the wrong way, it’s not your fault. It just means you’ve been hurt in the past. And as a result, you inadvertently hurt those around you, who in return, push you away and hurt you further. It’s a vicious cycle. But you can’t help it, because you aren’t even aware of it.\\n\\nBy now you may be saying, “Fuck this guy, what does he know? Where’s my back button?” Over the years, I’ve interacted with hundreds of people just like you. Emotional vampires are nothing new to me, and I feel that I’ve gotten good at spotting them. I’ve also gotten entangled with many earlier in my life and have the scars to prove it. So if you are experiencing many of the problems listed above in your life, or are close to someone who is, what’s there to lose in at least hearing me out to the end of the article?\\n\\nStop Being an Emotional Idiot Discover tips to become more self-aware, empathetic and emotionally intelligent. 49-page guide. Just drop your email below.\\n\\nWho Are Emotional Vampires?\\n\\nEmotional vampires are called emotional vampires because they have a tendency to drain the emotional energy out of everyone they come in contact with. They’re exhausting. They need constant attention. They always have some crisis or major life event. They’re experts at eliciting emotional reactions out of others and then feeding off those emotions, regardless of whether they’re positive emotions or negative emotions.\\n\\nAll emotional vampires suffer from low self-esteem, but not all people with low self-esteem are emotional vampires. Low self-esteem comes in a number of flavors and manifests itself differently from person to person, and emotional vampires are people with a specific subset of self-esteem issues.\\n\\nEmotional vampires exhibit three specific traits simultaneously: an excessive need for validation/attention from others, the belief that little to nothing that occurs is their fault, and the lack of self-awareness to recognize their self-defeating patterns. People who are familiar with Six Pillars of Self-Esteem by Nathaniel Branden will recognize that these are three of the six pillars — or rather, a lack of three of the pillars.\\n\\nThis is a dangerous combination for two reasons: 1) these three traits reinforce one another and make each other stronger, and 2) they can often suck in and hurt otherwise good people around them.\\n\\nAnd don’t be mistaken, emotional vampires are not all pathetic losers. They can be some of the most charming and successful people you meet. Men, women, beautiful, ugly, rich, poor, they come in many shapes and sizes. But they always create toxic relationships, both as romantic partners and as friends.\\n\\n1. An Excessive Need for Validation/Attention From Others: Conversations with emotional vampires are invariably dominated by one person: them. It’s all about them, their problems, how so-and-so was such a dick to them, how so-and-so wants to get back at them, how awesome they are, how pathetic they are, how everyone wants to be like them, how everyone hates them, etc. The torrential outpour of self-centeredness from them is either delusional in how awesome they think they are (“Everyone on my team at work wanted to work with me, but I told my manager that I couldn’t stand to be around Dave”) or delusional in how pathetic and helpless they are (“Nobody on the choir trip wants to room with me. It’s because they’re all so stuck up and are prettier than I am.”). Often these delusions of grandeur and victimization happen back-to-back within the same conversation. Either way, it only takes an hour of conversation with an emotional vampire before one is inspired to slam their forehead against a hard surface repeatedly. Make the noise stop. Please, make it stop.\\n\\nEmotional vampires are also apt to make grand public displays in order to garner attention. Again, these can be both self-serving or self-loathing. Think that annoying guy in the office who stands up and makes an inappropriate announcement just to get a few laughs. Or the girl at the party, who, when made fun of, throws a screaming fit and runs out of the room crying. As they say, there’s no such thing as bad publicity. And when you’re as attention-starved as emotional vampires, creating any sort of emotional reaction out of those around you — even if it’s indignation, pity, anger, or hatred — is worth it.\\n\\nThe excessive need for validation and attention is what pushes people away from the emotional vampire in the beginning. The constant need for affirmation drains people’s energy and patience. The emotional ups and downs, the dramatic successes and failures, they’re all tiring and most (self-respecting) people aren’t willing to tolerate it. Therefore, they’ll make a clear move to ignore the emotional vampire after meeting them, thus reaffirming to the vampire that people are mean, that nobody likes them, that they’re a victim and yes… it’s not their fault.\\n\\n2. The Belief that Their Problems Are Not Their Fault: The excessive needy behavior of emotional vampires elicits negative reactions from others and drives people away from them. But instead of considering that people responded negatively towards them because what they said/did was offensive or self-centered or rude or whiny or obnoxious or upsetting, they prefer to believe that all of those around them are assholes, racists, bigots, stuck up, rude, cold, etc., etc.\\n\\nThis combination of behaviors is insidious. The excessive need for validation leads to anti-social behavior, which leads to negative reactions from others, which leads the emotional vampire to blame others and feel even more victimized, which then leads to an even deeper need for validation, and then even more anti-social behavior, and so on…\\n\\nThe ability of an emotional vampire to rationalize his or her anti-social behavior can be mesmerizing. It goes way beyond simply projecting negative qualities onto others (i.e., “my boss fired me because he’s a dick,” and not “my boss fired me because I walk around calling people dicks behind their backs”).\\n\\nNo, the rationalizations can go far deeper than that: all men are pigs and just want sex; all women are entitled and stuck up; no one can really appreciate how cool/smart/witty/attractive/kind I am because everyone else is so self-centered. All the while, it’s obvious to anybody else that these people have it so hard because their attitudes suck and they are self-centered.\\n\\nThere is only one type of person who will let themselves get close to an emotional vampire: other low self-esteem individuals. They are either are too dysfunctional themselves to notice the negative effects the vampire’s behavior has on them, or they are emotional vampires themselves who crave the endless drama, attention, and victimization. Once again, we see that in emotional relationships like attracts like, and the old adage is true: that if everyone you date is crazy, then it probably means you’re crazy.\\n\\n3. Lack of Self-Awareness: One would think that an emotional vampire would eventually begin to detect the pattern in which they live — certain behaviors lead to certain reactions from others, these reactions are not pleasant so perhaps we should re-examine our behaviors and beliefs, that the only constant in all of your relationships is yourself, and if all of your relationships suck or are fucking up, then maybe you should start with the one thing they all have in common.\\n\\nThis would seem obvious, but it rarely occurs to the emotional vampire. They are not capable of being honest with themselves and accepting responsibility for their lives. Psychologically, they need a scapegoat — whether it’s blaming their appearance, the racism towards others, an office conspiracy against them, how mom and dad never treat them right, or an endless array of other self-defeating beliefs. They’ve always been so focused externally that they never developed an ability to sit down and analyze their own thoughts and emotions and question their utility. Emotional vampires often hate to be alone. They also tend to cause conflict if there isn’t any already. The reason is that they need to distract themselves from, well… themselves. This lack of awareness keeps their blame game going. The blame game keeps the search for validation and attention going. And the search for external validation and attention keeps the lack of self-awareness going. One big shit spiral.\\n\\nHow to Break Out of the Pattern\\n\\n“A loving person lives in a loving world, a hostile person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror.” – Ken Keyes, Jr.\\n\\nSo if you’re still reading this and thinking, “Oh crap, this is so me. I’m such a dick…” Relax. You’re not a dick. You didn’t know any better. And you can change things. Starting now.\\n\\nStep 1: Begin paying attention to what you have control over rather than what you don’t have control over. You can’t control whether your boss is a dick or not, or whether the girls in clubs are stuck up or whatever, or whether your co-workers don’t have the same interests as you. Therefore, it doesn’t matter and you should immediately stop worrying about it and blaming it for your problems. Ask yourself: what can you control? You can control your conduct at work. So start there. You can control your productivity. You can control how well you dress when you go out. Start there. And if you fail because of something or someone else, ignore it. It’s not important. Focus on what you control.\\n\\nStep 2: Practice gratitude and appreciation for what you DO have. Chances are, no matter how bad things are for you, they could easily be a lot worse. You could be disfigured, homeless, not have parents, have no education, etc. Make a point each morning when you wake up to look in the mirror and say one thing you’re thankful for, and feel it. Don’t just say it, actually feel the gratitude as you say it. “I am ridiculously grateful for my great education, it gives me a lot of opportunities that most people don’t have.” There. That wasn’t so hard. Make sure it’s something different each day.\\n\\nStep 3: Show appreciation for others. Start practicing random acts of kindness for your friends, family and those around you. I know you’re cringing right now. But you get what you give, and that external validation you’ve craved so much for your entire life will only come to you when you start giving validation to others, and doing it randomly.\\n\\nTry this as an experiment. Each day for a week, challenge yourself to do one of the following: give someone a compliment, thank someone close to you, or give someone a gift.\\n\\nSimple examples:\\n\\n“Hey Gina, your dress looks really nice today.”\\n\\n“Mom, I know we haven’t always gotten along, but I want to thank you for everything you’ve done for me.”\\n\\n“Hey Steve, they had a special in the cafeteria, so I bought you lunch.”\\n\\nI know this feels all mushy and stuff, but try it. And don’t expect anything in return. This is the most important part. Don’t turn around three days later and say, “Steve, you fuckface, you never bought me anything! Oh God, everyone hates me!”\\n\\nNo… don’t do that. You may want to. But control yourself. Please control yourself.\\n\\nThe three steps dismantle the feedback loop of the emotional vampire. Focusing only on things you can control forces you to begin taking responsibility for what happens to you. Practicing gratitude forces you to step out of your victim mentality of blaming others and seeking more validation. Showing appreciation invites genuine validation from others rather than superficial attention.\\n\\nAnd of course, consciously practicing these three things forces you to become more aware of your own actions and emotions. This will create a new, more positive feedback loop.\\n\\nNow, I imagine that a few of you reached this point in the article and are thinking, “Man, some people are just so clueless. Great article. But my problems are real. I actually do have a problem that I have no control over. He just doesn’t get it. Just like nobody else gets it. Oh well…”\\n\\nIf you found yourself saying that at any point during this article, I’ve got some bad news. You’re one of them. And you may want to scroll back up to the top and start all over again.',\n",

Oh, and I'm a hardcore PC, and tabletop gamer.\\n\\nIn this blog I want to hit on subjects that I don't have another medium for. Expect reviews of games old and new, though mostly old. Expect rants about the world in general. Expect the occasional lapse into convoluted personal philosophy. Oh and definitely expect some stuff on BDSM, after all I was a professional dominatrix for a few years and enjoy the BDSM lifestyle in my private life now.\\n\\nSo I hope you enjoy the randomness of my ruminations, and let the madness commence.\\n\\n(Please feel absolutely welcome to comment on any and all of my posts.

This is a little weird when you consider that for me hairlessness is one of the yummiest of the most delicious states. Yes, yes, I know that hairless girls (of any variety) remind you of a child, and going down…there when someone is hairless makes me akin to….no screw that.\\n\\nLook let’s make this simple. I hate getting my teeth flossed when I’m kissing a partners fun bits. I loathe getting clothing fluff in my mouth. I abhor how it feels against my face. It’s easier to keep clean, and to keep smelling nice. And it’s just frikkin’ prettier, period. Besides I’ve never understood girls who have down there pierced and tattooed, only to let all that work be covered up with wild uncontrolled growth.\\n\\nWell anyway I finally found a bikini trimmer in my hands, and I have to say so far I love it. I’m going to use a short list of why, but without mentioning brands. Because from what I can find in my research on the topic these seem to be nearly universal.\\n\\n1: No matter how tight you trim you’re probably not going to cut yourself. This is seriously not a minor consideration when you’re a girl of the Futa variety, as very little can ruin your day like taking a chunk out of your Miss Happy with a razor.\\n\\n2: No need to replace the blades constantly. Here’s the thing if your like me you’ve just shaved your legs, and then realised that you kind of look a little, um, Librarian, down there. So you shave there. Of course all this shaving means that you now have one very dead blade. So you change the blade before shaving under your arms. Only to find that your blades must have been against something hot that has melted something on them, or warped them, or otherwise made them as safe to use for a close shaving as a guillotine.\\n\\nFor those who aren’t Discworld fans, this is the Librarian…\\n\\nNow enter the trimmer. It doesn’t need its blades replacing. Just clean the blasted things after each use and you’re good to go.\\n\\n3: Speaking of legs, and underarms it’ll shave those too.\\n\\n4: You can use it in the shower, which means a whole lot less irritation.\\n\\n5: And with irritation in mind. How many of you have shaved the whole of down there? Most of you I would imagine, I think it’s one of those things we’ve all done at one stage or another. Well if you have then you probably experienced first the sheer sensuality of how it felt when you’d finished. Smooth, clean, moisturised (you did moisturise, right?). Just delicious. And then you pulled on a pair of satin panties and thought you’d died and gone to heaven. Of course two days later, or the next day if you’re really unlucky, the mind rending itching started…Isn’t that the pits?\\n\\nWell that doesn’t seem happen with these trimmers.\\n\\n6: apparently neither do the ingrown hairs.\\n\\n7: Or the infections they cause.\\n\\n8: There are really good but very cheap ones available. Seriously, for once there are budget options of something that work!\\n\\n9: Personal one this. I feel 100% more feminine, and more attractive afterwards. Nothing makes me feel less attractive than my body hair. Pre-transition I was kind of shaggy. No big deal when you’re pretending to be a boy, but a nightmare when you’re embracing your more female nature. While most of that body hair has just vanished in the past decade, the pubic area…not so much. And well, let’s put it this way shall we? Futa bits are WAY prettier bare, and when they’re tied with nice breasts, good hips, and a great ass, they actually manage to look really female. I know that’s a weird thing to say but they do. And this is all in part thanks to a good trim.\\n\\n10:Finally I don’t know about other people’s trimmers, but mine is very vibrate, umm, eee, at the non-cutting end. Just saying. For no reason what-so-ever.\",\n",

Yes, I look like that person who is continuously writing about such a topic. By the way, I am going to try so hard to get a better mark. so watch me saying anything.\\n\\nCan I say, they put headlines like… because…it is actually Mr. Dolce and Mr. Gabbna messed up, rather than the D&G brand itself? sorry, too much thinking but of course Mr. Dolce and Mr. Gabbana are okay to mess up, they have D&G and people would buy your names, sadly, just like she wore D&G for the Thanksgiving.\\n\\n“a bigCha ChChina problem“? I am not sure how to interpret this headline, but it sounds like “ah that China problem-” and trying to pull out what’s on readers minds of underlying all the political or ethical problems of China? so it’s like cookbooks, mentioned in the lecture, which do not explain what the garlic is, but we are going to make garlic bread. But you know what it tastes like. It’s what you like. You clicked it. *wink* *wink*\\n\\nAgain, back to the headline, that is definitely not a “specific” description. That is quite abstract. (Just like what Murdoch said about headlines, eh) and also the word, outrage… outrage… I think: Dolce and Gabbana did some marketing wrong. Why would you say the reaction was “outrageous” when consumers did what they can do? Of course, what they can do is telling ~~~~the fact~~~~ that D&G was being racist and stop buying the products. (Hi, that sounds like my personal bias)\\n\\n(By this point, I do not expect them to be super fair intellectuals of the world. Just think twice and do not ignore your staffs’ input. If the whole staffs were agreeing to this concept, yeah stop there. You got some HR problems.)\\n\\nWilkinson (the editor) did not put that “offensive comments that were allegedly sent from co-founder Stefano Gabbana’s personal Instagram account”- emojis of poo- poos- shit-shits are not … up to the CNN business column level.\\n\\nIn my understanding, (bias warning) Chinese people who have been buying luxuries (around me) tend to be cohesive because they were in such a coercive environment that only allowed them not to be ‘authentic’ as individual thinkers. When following trends like everyone else becomes the ultimate trend, whether it’s close to Hypodermic Model or Minimal Effects Model, they are just massive hotpot burning instantly hot and cool down.\\n\\nEveryone would get mad because the rest of them got mad.\\n\\n(Hi, that also sounds like my personal bias)\\n\\nDr.Watson: “Nothing sells like ‘scandal’.”\\n\\none of few things I was able to take a note in the class: Nothing sells like ‘scandal’.\\n\\nYeah, this is another scandal which will sell! because! you guys! care about rich Chinese consumers! and the economy!\\n\\nAlso, Again,\\n\\nDr.Watson: “Newspapers are not interested in what is covering, not really local. People buy more gossips.”\\n\\nCNN? American.\\n\\nDolce and Gabbna? Italirian\\n\\nChina? China.\\n\\nWho buys Dolce and Gabbana? people who have money.\\n\\nWhy I was aware of this scandal? I heard the news on my Twitter feed.\\n\\nSo is this good scandal? Yeah, people like to talk about racism.\\n\\nNOoo. Of course not they aren’t apologizing to “all Chinese people around the world”, my Chinese friend doing his work, sitting beside me, probably does not know such a scandal happened; because he isn’t a consumer of this (and also because he does cognitive psychology. I’m biased again. so what.)\\n\\nMass Society theory: he doesn’t have time to care.\\n\\nMinimal Effects Model: does not log in to the media talking about the scandal.\\n\\nNever went on to Yangmatou, Yoox Net-A-Porter, Alibaba and JD.com. I don’t know who Ben Cavender is, (obviously a senior analyst at China Market Research in Shanghai) neither Lane Crawford and Hung Huang. They might be ‘professionals’ who have insights on this scandal, all saying “The damage is huge”\\n\\nBut I am quite sure, that Chinese people will eventually buy D&G products again, if D&G does a good job in next seasons and if D&G sponsor to the great celebs that Chinese people care.\\n\\nLike, CEO of Starbucks is not great. I was not supposed to support him by buying my coffees at Starbucks, but I rather collect reward stars when I buy coffees. Classic capitalism.\\n\\nDr.Watson: “Advertisers do not have that much concerned, as long as people buy products.”\\n\\nI don’t want to explain Fan Bingbing. I have a limited time and energy and words to put here like news editors can’t put the full stories.\\n\\nAnd I’m quite skeptical about why Wilkinson (the editor) finished his article by whomever “argued that China needs to be more tolerant in order to show the world it’s an open market.”\\n\\nHaha, what are you telling me, Wilkinson? haha, Of course, China can be intolerant but ~~~in the house~~ we don’t make you look foolish to and make that as “D&G loves you” campaign.\\n\\nI am not sure how I can reduce the bias here. I might just show ‘raw’ elements of the news: Put the D&G campaign videos, capture people’s comments (but I can’t put all of them), put what Stefano Gabbana said on his DMs, and the fact that D&G disappeared on the Chinese websites?\\n\\nAlso, @stefanogabbna, don’t say “I love China and Chinese Culture” when you apologize for what you have said.\\n\\nIt was so obvious that Gabbana was using social media for economic purposes (so he does not lose D&G fans) rather than more altruistic purposes’ (referencing the last slide of Lecture 9).',\n",

       " 'Sebastian Vettel seldom shows the more serious side to his character © Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News:\\n\\nVettel blames \\'cucumber\\' Karthikeyan for puncture\\n\\nDrivers:\\n\\nSebastian Vettel Teams:\\n\\nRed Bull\\n\\nHow a driver celebrates in victory reveals little about his true character, but defeat offers a genuine insight into the man behind the visor. Formula One\\'s insatiable appetite for news and reaction means drivers are thrown into TV interviews just minutes after stepping out of the cockpit and often without the opportunity to decompress their thoughts. For the most part they automatically revert to their media training and give nothing away, but sometimes they struggle to hold back.\\n\\nAfter stepping out of the 50C heat of his Red Bull cockpit in Malaysia, Sebastian Vettel saw no reason to hold back. With his hair still soaked in sweat, he reflected on his collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan, which shredded his tyre and ruined his race. Speaking in his native German he criticised Karthikeyan\\'s driving and labelled the HRT driver a \"cucumber\" (or possibly a gherkin depending on your German translation). Speaking to the BBC he ruled out any ambiguity by simply referring to Karthikeyan as an \"idiot\".\\n\\nWatching the BBC interview it was compelling to see the happy-go-lucky Vettel that we\\'ve come to know and love from top three press conferences transform into the deadly serious persona we\\'ve only heard exists behind closed doors in the Red Bull motorhome. It was an insight, albeit a very brief one, into the steely determination that lies beneath Vettel\\'s polished veneer of humour and one-liners. That\\'s not to say he isn\\'t being genuine when he smiles for the cameras and jokes with journalists, it\\'s just that his character is much deeper than that and his success has come from knowing when to be stern and when to be laid back.\\n\\nBy most accounts last season was a breeze for Vettel, and for the majority of the time we enjoyed the affable side of his personality as he collected poles and wins. However, his demeanour at the Belgian Grand Prix was notably different as he learnt that his car\\'s suspension settings were putting undue stress on the tyres which had the potential to cause a failure. On the Sunday morning before that race the serious side of Vettel came to the fore as he held a heated and very open conversation with a Pirelli technician in the middle of the paddock. I was lucky enough to observe that conversation, out of earshot I might add, but it was clear he wanted to know exactly what he was up against and didn\\'t care who knew about it.\\n\\nHis comments in Malaysia were much the same. Vettel knows just how important 12 points could be by the end of the season and in his mind Karthikeyan robbed him of them with a clumsy error. You may not agree with Vettel about the accident (although the stewards gave Karthikeyan a post-race penalty after reviewing all the evidence), but he got his message across.\\n\\nOf course, Vettel is not the first driver to speak his mind following a race and he certainly won\\'t be the last. Think back to Felipe Massa\\'s incomprehensible rant about Lewis Hamilton at Singapore last year and the subsequent pat/thump on the back he gave the McLaren driver in the interview pen. Earlier in the year at Monaco, Hamilton was the one creating headlines when he slagged off not only his fellow competitors but also the stewards. Such displays of emotion often take TV audiences by surprise, but think back to the last time you were badly cut up on the road and the irrational anger that welled up inside and you start to understand the stress these guys are under.\\n\\nBut the trick is to pick the battles worth fighting and, ideally, pick ones you can win. By bad-mouthing the stewards Hamilton didn\\'t do himself any favours and the McLaren PR machine went into overdrive to cover for their man. Equally Massa\\'s pleas for the FIA to act against Hamilton did nothing to diffuse the growing animosity between the two drivers and ultimately it didn\\'t do either of them any favours. However, the next time Vettel comes up to lap Karthikeyan the HRT driver will no doubt make extra room as, even if Karthikeyan didn\\'t think the collision in Malaysia was his fault, another incident would damage his reputation far more than Vettel\\'s. It may have cost Seb 12 points this time, but his comments after the race could help him towards 25 at the next race.',\n",

       " 'As a kid I was obsessed with an abandoned house in the cow pasture across the street from my friend Anna\\'s house. We never went inside, but just walking by was enough to freak me out. tThe roof caved in on the stone walls, every window was a punched-out eye, and I knew that if there was a murderer lurking around the woods at night, the murderer lived in that house. The rumors didn\\'t help either. Local legend had it that high school boys used to hang out there until someone fell through the rotted second floor and broke his leg. No town is complete without a haunted house and the lore that comes with it. In honor of that ghoulish and seasonally appropriate fact, here are 10 haunted house novels that will scare you more than the chained-up shed at the edge of your neighbor\\'s property or that condemned mansion behind your elementary school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson\\n\\nThe greatest haunted house novel ever written. Remember all those crap movies where a bunch of attractive people get together in a house that\\'s purportedly haunted to study the frequencies, or whatever, and then they get slashed one by one (after having rampant sex with each other)? Thank Shirley Jackson. \"The Haunting of Hill House\" inaugurated that premise, and its first iteration is about fifty-five million times more terrifying and subtle and well-written than anything you\\'ve read or seen. Which is probably why it has been stolen and shittily adapted so many times (with a few notable exceptions-including #9). Jackson understands there\\'s a fine line between fear and hilarity-you\\'ll love her characters for cracking jokes to stave off their anxiety, but their glibness will also frighten you.\\n\\nStill have doubts? Consider the opening: \"No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood for eighty years and might stand for eighty more.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rustication\" by Charles Palliser\\n\\nWhen opium-addled Richard Shenstone, the 17-year old narrator of Charles Palliser\\'s Gothic melodrama, grabs your hand and leads you into his twisted world of sexual obsession, murder, and sadistic letters (which may or may not be Richard\\'s doing), you won\\'t want to let go. The newly destitute Shenstones are forced to inhabit a dilapidated old mansion where Richard\\'s unsteady mind makes much out of rooms with beds made for people he\\'s never met and things that go bump in the night. Though the house isn\\'t the source of evil, it deserves lots of credit for the book\\'s spooky atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Shining\" by Stephen King\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Overlook isn\\'t a house, but it\\'s more thoroughly haunted than any place in the fictional universe. Nobody who\\'s read \"The Shining\" can forget the images from its pages--the twin girls at the end of the hallway, the magically stocked bar, the topiary animals, the party hat in the elevator, the blood-smeared walls, the naked woman from the bathtub transforming into a rotting corpse. Stephen King, puppet-master behind the world\\'s worst nightmares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Little Stranger\" by Sarah Water\\n\\nThe once-aristocratic Ayres family is clinging to Hundreds Hall, their crumbling 18th century estate that\\'s a relic of its former glory. After a visiting child is mauled by a typically docile family dog, strange things begin happening at Hundreds. Childish writing appears in places where various family members have reported hearing tapping; even the maids are convinced that there\\'s something (and something possibly contagious) wrong with the house. The novel only gets creepier as the ever rational narrator Dr. Faraday tries to explain away each frightening incident with a dismissive blend of science and logic. The discord between his unsatisfying explanations and the burned walls, source-less noises and eventual violence will leave you with unsettling memories of creepy things you\\'ve dismissed--and maybe shouldn\\'t have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"O My Darling\" by Amity Gaige\\n\\nYou won\\'t find Amity Gaige\\'s (\"Shroder\") first novel classified as horror on Amazon or at your local indie (well, maybe at your indie). But this story of a marriage that almost implodes after Charlotte and Clark Adair move into their \"dream\" home has all of the elements of a true haunted house novel: ghosts/shadows fluttering around corners, discontented characters losing their ability to communicate, intruders with nefarious intent, disembodied voices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\" by Shirley Jackson\\n\\nShirley Jackson again! I like to think of this slim, stylistically astonishing novel as a kind of haunted house origin story. (See also: Miss Havisham, \"Great Expectations.\") Merricat and Constance Blackwood live with their batty Uncle Julian in a lavish house on the outskirts of town. They are the only survivors of a poisoning incident that killed off the rest of their family. The townspeople are convinced that Constance is a murderer, but is she really the one responsible for the mass killing? When the townspeople turn on the remaining Blackwoods they\\'re forced into total isolation, entombing themselves in the home that\\'s both their sanctuary and their curse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Shining Girls\" by Lauren Beukes\\n\\nHarper Curtis is far more deadly than your garden variety serial killer. Harper isn\\'t constricted by time--he can move freely between the past, present, and future, planting memories in his victim\\'s childhoods before chasing them through the years to the moments of their gruesome deaths (which of course feel horrifyingly inevitable). The mechanism for his time travel is a House. The House is described as a being with godly power over Harper--it urges him on, inspiring the bloodlust that drives him to kill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great Expectations\" by Charles Dickens\\n\\nWhen I first read \"Great Expectations\" as a high school freshman I completely glossed over the terrifying reality of Miss Havisham, who wears an old wedding dress and has left her mouldering wedding cake on the table for decades. Every clock in Satis House, her decaying mansion, is stopped at twenty minutes to nine-the exact moment she found out she was being left at the altar. She wears a single shoe, and eventually dies of burns (after the wedding dress catches fire). Is anything more upsetting than this? The story of Miss Havisham is the story of HOW a house becomes haunted. She\\'s Satis House\\'s ghostly lore. Or would be, if Satis House existed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hell House\" by Richard Matheson\\n\\nIt\\'s clear to any Shirley Jackson fan (cough, cough) that Richard Matheson\\'s \"Hell House\" owes a significant debt to \"The Haunting of Hill House.\" But this novel, in keeping (perhaps) with its later pub date, is less psychologically unnerving than it is Hollywood in-your-face scary. It favors the holy trinity of horror tropes: Blood, Sex and Suspense. \"Hell House,\" unlike so many Jackson knockoffs, is a fitting tribute to its inspiration--and it embellishes Jackson\\'s storyline with scares that are all its own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The House of Leaves\" by Mark Danielewski\\n\\nHaunted house novels work best when the house is the scariest character. After returning from a trip, the Navidson family notices that there\\'s something wrong with their home. Doors appear where there weren\\'t any before, secret passageways seem to have been formed by someone/something with sinister intent, staircases lead nowhere. Characters report hearing a low growl, as if the house, itself, is a monster. Danielewski\\'s novel looks more like a puzzle box than a book, with typographical hijinks on almost every page--lines of text running vertically or backwards, copious footnotes, unpredictable blasts of white space. This visual chaos exponentially increases the goose-bump factor.',\n",
       " \"Tag Archives: disappointment\\n\\nWow, I can’t believe it’s been three months since I wrote my last entry. Originally, I pledged to write at least once a month… please accept my apologies …\\n\\nSo what did I do?\\n\\nI really focused on finishing my thesis to the point that I now can’t even look at it without contempt anymore. I really really hate it by now. I guess and hope that this is normal. The thing is, I still have to do a presentation and an oral examination. Only then I’m done. I dream of some kind of fire ritual to burn my thesis and clean my brain 😉 I know, stupid, but it helps to read it for the 120th time…\\n\\nI’ve chosen the worst possible guy to proofread my thesis. At first he hit on me although he’s twice my age and now he has let me down and needed a month for a whole of 30 pages. Please don’t judge. I thought he was professional. At least the work he did on my 30 pages is good 😉 Well, live and learn… Let’s hope the next one is more reliable.\\n\\nI’ve been to every professor and secretary available at our institute to get the enormous amount of signatures to even hand in the thesis. Tracking down the guy who’s always out having his breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner is pretty much impossible …\\n\\nI’ve had about 3-5 (maybe more like 5-10) nervous crying fits when something went wrong with my thesis. I’ve pledged to let my boyfriend have his when he will write his own thesis.\\n\\nMy computer “died” at the appropriate time, just when I was doing my literature list. I guess the thesis wore the computer down too … Of course, that prompted another crying fit. Luckily, I obey to the golden rule of backup, backup, backup and I only had to redo an hour. But still, that hour sucked! Badly!\\n\\nvia cartoonstock.com\\n\\nOne of my uncles died and now it came out that he has another “secret daughter”. What is it with all those family secrets?! This was that uncle’s favourite saying, which I really liked:\\n\\nOhne Arbeit früh bis spät kann dir nichts geraten,\\n\\nNeid sieht nur das Blumenbeet, aber nicht den Spaten.\\n\\nRoughly translated (and very poorly, please forgive me … this saying means: Without work from dust till dawn, you will achieve nothing. Envy only sees the flower bed, but not the spade. (I’m sure there is some equivalent in English that I don’t know of …)\\n\\nHis children may not enjoy his lifetime’s work now because they have to share with another unknown sibling. So remember, if you have any secret children, make sure to tell the children you live with ahead of your death what awaits them!\\n\\nI still feel bad because of my dad sometimes. But lately, I just tell people straight away that he’s gone to get it out of the way when they ask. And last time, a girl forgot that I had told her that he is dead and asked me what my mom or my dad think of something. That was pretty disturbing. I didn’t feel too troubled about it, but I think I need to readjust my strategy. What proofed to be successful in your experience to get the point across that someone’s dead?!\\n\\nSomebody broke into our home last week. We thought that our apartment looks so crappy nobody would bother to even do that. Besides, Vienna is pretty safe. And we don’t live in a posh neighborhood. Apparently, that is no security. Mr. Burglar (it must have been a guy considering the things he’s stolen) stole the hard-safed money from my boyfriend, his PSP and, strangely enough, his brand new running shoes. Mr. Burglar has taste. He didn’t take my Nintendo DS, the Wii, or my boyfriend’s 10-year old running shoes that were standing next to the new ones. My boyfriend’s actually more pissed that his progress at GTA has gone to waste than about the money. And with the shoes, it’s getting personal\\n\\nvia cartoonstock.com\\n\\nNaturally, nobody told us that this apartment has been broken into two times already. Would have been nice if somebody advised us to change the lock when we were so stupid not to do it. So, I’ve learned the lesson that even the crappiest apartment is a target for burglars.\\n\\nMe and my boyfriend actually bought the running shoes together and we used to merrily run alongside, like a cheesy couple. I liked it. Now Mr. Burglar has taken away that too, because it doesn’t have the same feel to it when I have my shiny new shoes while he has to run in his crappy old ones. That guy is so mean!\\n\\nThe secretary I wrote about in this and this post is already shining in its new glory, courtesy of my cousin. Pictures will follow in a next post 🙂 It was the right decision to give it to her!\\n\\nSpeaking of which, we’ve found a guy who’s willing to rent my grandmother’s house, but only for a very small amount of money. On top of all, I have to prepare myself for grueling negotiations over the weekend. It gets tiring, really.\\n\\nI’ve watched a ton of Korean Dramas in these past months. Those are the best to keep your thoughts away and just turn off your brain. So if you have a hard time with something, I can give you a list of the most perfect “braindead” dramas that there are …Of course, this is also a way not to forget my Korean, even if it’s Drama-speech … so it’s a win-win 🙂\\n\\nKorean Dramas are also a perfect way to win new friends. There’s nothing like swooning over a guy with other girls. I’m currently in the “courtship” phase with a girl that wants to be my friend (yay 😉 ) We will meet up to watch dramas, eat and drink. Another win-win 🙂\\n\\nvia cartoonstock.com\\n\\nSpeaking of drinking, I learned a few new drinking games, most of them from Korea. I’ve already established in that post that Koreans have a thriving drinking culture. It’s a funny contrast to us Austrians, who only sit together getting wasted while talking.\\n\\nI found out that my English is pretty bad, so please don’t hesitate to point out any mistakes I make! Really!!\\n\\nMy family has lost all hope that I’ll ever graduate anymore. I lost hope that it still happens this year. I guess subconsciously I really put it off so not to get to the next stage, which is unemployment 😉 Oh my…\\n\\nSo, that is a tiny fraction of what I did. Even if it’s pathetic, I hope you enjoyed 😉\\n\\nI’m an avid fan of stars. As a kid, I even listed “looking at stars” as my hobby in autograph books. To check out those stars and get a first-hand impression, I booked a tour to one of the observatories in Vienna. Last week, it was raining and the sky was pretty clouded, but our guides informed us via e-mail that we nevertheless could have our tour. But when we arrived, those clouds hadn’t gone away, like they were convinced of in the afternoon. It was very disappointing, we couldn’t look at anything else but clouds. Children were crying, desperate father’s yearned for amusement for their children, couples were crying out that their romantic evening was ruined, chaos ensued.\\n\\nYeah…it wasn’t like that. But it could have been 😉 Despite this throwback, I optimistically booked another tour for today. Today it couldn’t have been sunnier and I was really excited to finally see stars in the evening. Well, until half an hour ago. The tour isn’t happening 😦 Those clouds are coming back and we would not see anything. This is tragic! I think heaven doesn’t want me to look at it. But I’m not gonna give in … Maybe someone could put in a good word for me with heaven … Please, please let me have a look next week! I’ll be good …\\n\\nNot long ago, I inherited the house of my grandmother. It’s in the middle of nowhere and it’s so little and pretty and from another century that it’s heartbreaking. I would move in the minute I could if it would be in Vienna. But since it’s not, I now want to rent it out to somebody nice. If I find someone who’s willing to move out there 😉 And if I find someone who is willing to pay me some rent for such an old house…but that is a whole different story 😉\\n\\nThe secretary of my grandfather isn't that beautiful, but that one caught my eye. Maybe I'm gonna treat myself to one of those when I'm older... picture via inetgiant.com\\n\\nUntil I find that certain someone, I have to clear out the house. Which is a difficult task, considering it’s full of stuff my relatives loaded there the last few years since my grandmother died. The only thing I would have liked to keep was a little secretary that belonged to my grandfather. It has those little drawers and doors with tiny, beautiful keys. It also has a hutch with a round, built-in ceramic picture. I don’t think it’s antique but it is definitely charming. My granddad stored his most beloved things in there and nobody even dared to touch it. He died before I was born but interestingly, drawings he drew when he was a child only came to light when I was already in my teens. Somebody “dared” to look into the secretary and found those little beautiful drawings of his childhood home in the woods with a pond in front. He never showed those pictures to anyone. Not even my grandmother knew of their existence. Nowadays, all of his children have a photocopy of that drawing in their home and the original hangs in the house I inherited now.\\n\\nJust a nice little back story to get to the point … because last week I told my mom to ask her siblings or my cousins if they wanted to have something from the house. Never did I think that somebody would want the secretary…\\n\\nAs it happens, my mom visited a cousin of mine last week. When mom mentioned the house, my cousin carefully asked her what would happen to the secretary. THE secretary. Of course. At first I was shocked. Disappointed. Sad. I couldn’t believe that she had the nerve to suggest to give her the secretary. She put me in an awful position. How could I refuse her wish? I was very upset and felt trapped. Grumpily, I told my boyfriend the story who wasn’t very impressed, since we don’t even have room for it. I would store it in some place that doesn’t do it justice. I still brooded over it a few minutes, and then I let go.\\n\\nvia cartoonstock.com\\n\\nMy cousin still knew my grandfather. Maybe she even saw him sitting there, writing letters or something. She still knows the real purpose of it. Additionally, she studied art and definitely knows how to restore the secretary to its old glory. With me, I would maybe paint it, but I would spoil the old appearance. If she gets it, the secretary will definitely stand in a fitting place in her house so that everybody can admire it. And then people will ask where it’s from, and she can tell stories about our grandfather. People should definitely hear more stories of him! He seems to have been a wonderful man. If I would have it, nobody would get to see it since I don’t have space. And that would be a pity. The most important point though, as my grandma (the other grandma who’s still living) always says: “You can’t take it with you when you die.”\\n\\nI think of this saying a lot whenever I treasure material things too much so that they start to become a burden. I don’t want this flat to be my last one. I don’t want to only live here in Vienna. I hope to move a lot and get to know lot’s of places. How can I possess furniture if I want to do that? Where would I store it? Would it be fair to the furniture? Definitely not. What’s also important is that I can make my cousin happy. I always like to make others happy and this gives more comfort than holding on to it. Besides, she has four children. Those kids didn’t know our grandfather either, maybe they will appreciate their roots through the secretary. In the end, I hope I can admire the secretary in her house sometime with a feeling of perfect contentment. And maybe this is the chance to get back my Game boy I borrowed one of her kids in 1999 or something … what can I say, yet another crazy backstory 😉\",\n",

A finger to the lips silenced Josh’s questions as snake man shuffled along the alley.\\n\\nGeoffrey Mortimer - snake man, had earned his reptilian moniker for two reasons. One he kept snakes, two he looked remarkably like one. The skin on his face stretched to peeling point over a high boned brow and small flat nose.\\n\\nA pale tongue tasted the air, darting from dry compressed lips, and his scant hair clung to a shiny liver spotted pate. He stood six three but weighed no more than 10 stone, adding weight (or lack of it) to the overall serpentine appearance.\\n\\nA tin can found its target with a resounding thump.

Besides, he didn’t like the threatening look in his eye.\\n\\n“Follow me!” Ace yelled sprinting off.\\n\\nTen minutes later they hid in the bushes outside a dilapidated terraced house. “What are we doing?” panted Josh “Quiet! Just do as I say.”\\n\\nGeoffrey appeared seconds later and started to unlock the door. As he turned the handle Ace sprang up pushing him inside. Josh followed.\\n\\n“What do you want? I’ve no money,” Geoffrey whined. “You have snake man, and we want it.”\\n\\nJosh didn’t like the way things were going.\\n\\n“Ok we scared him, let’s go.” “Go? No way! This man’s a pet killer, feeds em to his snakes. My dog Shandy went missing the other day.” “These snakes are too little to eat pets!” Geoffrey pointed to a few docile worms asleep in tanks. “Give us yer money.” “I don’t...” Ace flicked open a knife and speared the nearest snake.\\n\\nThis was enough for Josh - he ran out.\\n\\n“Ok, please stop! Go through that door and open the door under the rug.”Ace grinned and went in. He kicked back the rug and wrenched open the trap door.\\n\\nIt took a few minutes for the screams to stop but at last calm was restored. Geoffrey smiled indulgently as the constrictor began to swallow its meat.\\n\\n“Looks like you won’t be needing that Alsatian for a while eh Boris?”he chuckled.\\n\\nSunday, 24 October 2010\\n\\nWent to the opticians last week and had an eye test. You'd be pretty shocked if I said I had a filling now wouldn't you?\\n\\nAnyway, apparently I have enlarged optic nerves. That's the important bit at the back of your eye ball that keeps your eyes glued to your brain. The optician said I needed to have photographs taken of the back of my eye to make sure there was no sign of glaucoma.\\n\\nWell I tell you I nearly fell into one at the very mention of it! (a coma..do keep up). Thing was they couldn't do it 'til the following week. I shouldn't worry too much though she said as every other sign indicated normality - well obviously not complete normality as it is me we're talking about!\\n\\nSo anyway you can imagine all week I was worrying that the photos would show abnormality and I'd been on the Internet looking at all the horrid things associated with enlarged optic nerves. Tumours - all sorts! Too much information - scared myself witless.\\n\\nThis Friday morning I was driving to work - the photos were due to be done later that day. It was a particularly dark morning, cold, drizzly and miserable - I felt that winter had truly arrived. The cars all had their headlights on and every driver's face seemed to reflect my mask of woe.\\n\\nThen on the radio came the old song Mr. Blue Sky by E.L.O. I loved it when it was in the charts when I was a teenager, but since those times have thought it sounded a bit cheesy.\\n\\nFor some reason listening to it again on that miserable morning it lifted my spirits. I half expected the dark clouds to part theatrically allowing the blue to shine through. And you know it is a very good bit of work. The orchestra and the 'bom bom bom' vocals toward the end are brilliant.\\n\\nMaybe I didn't appreciate it as much when I was younger, maybe it had the advantage of nostalgia, maybe I'm crackers, but I thought... even if the photos bring bad news glaucoma or tumour, something worse I haven't had such a bad run.\\n\\nI felt grateful for the life I had, and even if my sight failed I started to remember all the fantastic sights I had seen over the years.Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Pacific Ocean rollers, too many more to mention and of course the faces of my wonderful family and friends.\\n\\nBy the time I arrived at school (work) I felt sooo much better. Even the miserable drivers I passed on the way cheered up and began to sing along waving their arms in time to E.L.O.(no not really, that bit is a fib)\\n\\nWell anyhow - the photos were duly taken that afternoon and thankfully they were OK! I have to keep my eye on them (pun was intended) and have the photos done every 3 years or so, but apart from that all is well.\\n\\nSo thanks E.L.O and I'll never think you were cheesy ever again, promise :)\\n\\nThursday, 21 October 2010\\n\\nI once read that an ‘upwelling’ was an oceanographic term describing the movement of nutrients to the surface of the water. This phenomenon brings shoals of fish in huge numbers to feast on the bounty.\\n\\nI was witnessing the human equivalent.\\n\\nHer tanned body slipped from the pool.\\n\\nRivulets silver in the moonlight trickled from golden hair to breasts and hips - a liquid accentuation of curves.\\n\\nA feeding frenzy of would be suitors offered towels, champagne and adoration.\\n\\nShe declined. I had her sole attention, her hand and her marriage vows.\\n\\nThursday, 14 October 2010\\n\\n“So you didn’t win again? Not even bloody shortlisted! Give it up for God’s sake!”\\n\\nHe logged off and headed downstairs, but her demanding rant followed - drilled into his brain.\\n\\n“How much have you chucked away this month on these bloody stupid competitions? “\\n\\n“Not that much, a fiver here a fiver there,” he switched the radio on to drown her out.\\n\\nIt didn’t work.\\n\\n“Yes but it all adds up doesn’t it eh? Have you seen those bills piling up over there since you decided to go part-time so you could swan about pretending to be a writer? ’I must follow my dream’ you say, all shiny eyed. You’re hardly sodding Martin Luther King are you? And all the time you chuck good money after bad, month after month on these scribbling you call stories. They must see you coming and laugh all the way to the bank!”\\n\\n“OK, I’ll cut back a bit, perhaps just enter two next month,” he poured a good glug of red and dived into it.\\n\\n“Oh and when have we heard that one before huh? You can’t help yourself. It’s like you’re addicted, telling yourself you have a good feeling about a ‘story’...yup, this is the one. You’re like a broken record. What’s the old song by Tony Bennett? How’s it go now? Oh yeah, ‘maybe this time I’ll be lucky , maybe this time I’ll win’...well you don’t stand a cat in hell’s chance, so quit it.”\\n\\nHe ran his fingers through his hair and poured another.\\n\\n“And you can forget buying that stuff soon as well. Wallowing in booze and self-pity is too expensive. In fact, go to see the boss on Monday, ask him if you can have the extra hours back. It’s time you came to your senses before we end up living under the bloody viaduct in a cardboard box!”\\n\\n“There’s still the novels...I’m waiting on a couple of agents.”\\n\\n“Oh please! If you can’t make it with the scribblings what chance do you have with novels?”\\n\\n“For God’s sake shut up!” he threw the glass against the wall and fled back upstairs.\\n\\n“Oh that’s mature. Artistic temperament is it? More like a bloody kid’s tantrum if you ask...”\\n\\nHe slammed the door cutting off his nagging conscience in mid rant. At last a bit of quiet.\\n\\nIn his head of course, it was always only in his head. The things he’d pictured doing to her when he was Alfonso couldn’t be voiced - he’d be carted off to the secure unit.\\n\\nPart of him secretly longed for that though. The padded cell, the protection of the straight jacket – she couldn’t get to him there, wound him with her throw away lacerations.\\n\\nFrom the plush carpet he picked discarded clothing and dirty underwear, relishing their silky feel on his skin before depositing them in the laundry.\\n\\n“For God’s sake blubber boy; you’re such a disgusting excuse for a human being!” she shouted from the bathroom.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” he asked, already realising she’d seen him lingering over her knickers through the mirror.\\n\\n“You know what I mean. Mind you that’s as close as you’ll ever get to a woman intimately, you being the size of a row of houses an all.”\\n\\n“I’m not that fat Cassandra!”\\n\\n“Wanna bet? If you got on top of a girl she’d feel like she’d been crushed by avalanche! Now book me that taxi I’ve to be at the studio in an hour, and make sure my liposuction’s sorted for tomorrow.”\\n\\nLiposuction ... she looked like a stick insect already.Nevertheless she was his stick insect and he worshipped her. He’d been her personal slave for the last five years, tending to her every need and whim.\\n\\nAlfie loved that she needed him. That would have to be enough. He put up with her cruelty just to be near her.\\n\\nTuesday, 5 October 2010\\n\\nI found out about Flash fiction only about a year ago. Well, when I say I found out about it, I kind of knew what it was as it popped up in competitions and such, but I'd previously dismissed the concept.\\n\\nI couldn't see the point of squeezing a story into a word count of 500 words or below? Some Flash fiction can be of a 1000 words, but generally it tends to be fewer.\\n\\nIt seemed to me as if the whole thing was just about playing a literary game for the sake of it. Some pieces of flash I read seemed meaningless and flat, yet others I began to realise were very well executed.\\n\\nWhat made these better pieces stand out was that every word counted. Each word had been carefully selected and considered to create maximum impact. The writer of Flash is denied the luxury to faff and frill around the edges of a story because of the word count.In order to engender the reader's empathy, invoke emotion, or induce a belly laugh, the words used must be tailor made for the task.\\n\\nI had a few cracks at it, and I must say I really enjoyed the challenge. It became more than a literary game for it's own sake, and I found it really helped me focus on the message/meaning of the story. I tend to always have a message/meaning somewhere in my writing as I guess if it means nothing to me, why should it mean anything to anyone else?\\n\\nWords have the power to sometimes change lives, the course of history, or just bring a smile to a sad face.

When a Raider explodes, it doesn't murder a large number of the embarked warriors anymore, and they're tougher to begin with. PFP no longer has overlapping rules with Coven units. Putting heavy weapons in a Scourge squad isn't pants on head stupid any more. There's actually a reason to use the demiklaive. Scourges are looking fantastic and it makes sense to use heavy weapons with them now. Half the armies in the game aren't immune to phantasm grenades any more.

You are right with all of that except the phantasm grenade launcher. I think it´s a stupid weapon. I´d prefer to kill an enemy, that counts as lowering the enemy leadership by one, too!Or maybe, if the enemy leadership would be lowered for every hit of it, to a maximum of three. Something like that.\\n\\nWell. It´s only 3 points on the bright side so maybe I´ll still use it.\\n\\nI've seen a few people say similar things about Wyches but what exactly about them is not crap now? They are slightly more survivable in that most stuff wounds them on 3+ rather than 2+ now and they might actually take an armour save every now and then. But their Dodge save is still Fight phase only, their FNP is now half as effective, their damage output is still just about zero, their special weapons are bland and inoffensive (a real drawback in a weapon) and their special ability is pretty naff as it's a simple roll off and not influenced by any other factors, like a buff for x number of models in the unit or having a Succubus nearby.\\n\\nIn short, what is it that isn't utter crap now?\\n\\n_________________You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.

Not saying they're fantastic but they certainly have better offensive synergies than they used to.\\n\\nI'm more than a little disappointed with the amount of 2+ to hits everywhere. A Succubus hits on a 2+ as equally as a Haemunculi does and the Haemonculi is better at it! With more attacks and a straight up better weapon (Electro-corrosive whip is exactly the agoniser with dmg 2), 5+ invul at all times and T5. <- That's just not right.\\n\\nTheBaconPopeWych\\n\\nPosts : 662Join date : 2017-03-10\\n\\nSubject: Re: DE Rule Leaks Thu Jun 01 2017, 01:17\\n\\nQuote :\\n\\nHow about hitting on a 2+ by turn 3?

Wyches are supposed to be in combat Turn 2.

A SM captain has the imperium and adeptus astartes factions. So every other unit in his detachment must have the imperium faction or they must all have the adeptus astartes keyword.\\n\\nDoes that mean the imperium (and aeldari) can just make massive cluster piles?\\n\\nI ask because the ynnari characters have only the ynnari and aeldari keywords but are given a special rule to allow them to ride drukhari and asuryan transports. So they can be taken in those armies clearly but the only way that's true is if (aeldari) is enough of a faction to count as all from the same faction.\",\n",

       " 'Aging Punk Not Sure How to Stop Buying Skate Shoes\\n\\nPHILADELPHIA — Local 33-year-old Seth Bourne is completely unable and unwilling to buy any shoes that are not specifically designed for skateboarding, according to concerned family members.\\n\\n“Seth got promoted from shipping to sales, and now he has to dress business-casual. It’s really freaking him out,” said Beth Bourne-Radler, his wife of four years. “I tried to bring him to find some Oxfords or something, but after five minutes in the store, he started muttering about how he’s a ‘sell out’ and a ‘poser,’ and that ‘slip-ons are business-casual enough.’”\\n\\nBourne, who has reportedly worn skate shoes ever since buying his first pair of Duffs in 1996, claimed he doesn’t feel comfortable in anything else.\\n\\n“I’ve gone through all the phases, man. Kostons, Nike SBs — all of ‘em, except DC. They never really vibed with me,” said Bourne. “When I was 17, my mother made me wear loafers to my grandfather’s funeral. I know everyone was thinking how dumb my feet looked the entire time.”\\n\\nThe shoe alternatives Bourne has found have only heightened his frustrations.\\n\\n“Right now, it seems like everyone I meet is wearing these weird-ass leather elf boots. I feel like a fraud when my Skyrim character wears that shit, so those are out of the question for me,” said Bourne, applying a thick layer of Shoe Goo to his well-worn pair of Vans. “I don’t eat food on my lunch break — I go to the skatepark for 45 minutes. Do these people really expect me to skate in wingtips? It ain’t gonna happen.”\\n\\nAdding to the stress, the Bournes are reportedly expecting their first child in two months.\\n\\n“While I want to provide food and shelter for my child, I need my baby to respect me — and I can’t tre flip in docksiders, let alone hit something as simple as a five stair. I’m not bringing much else to the table, dad-wise,” said Bourne. “The kid is going to look super-cute in baby Emerica shoes, though.”\\n\\nAs of press time, Bourne found a temporary solution to the dress code by painting laces on his checkered socks.\\n\\nPhoto by Shelby Kettrick @ShelbyShootsStuff.',\n",
       " \"I do not think that Gantz Racist but Oku Hiroya may dislike afroamericans or americans at all. US deffinatly not the best friend of the japan. After someone blast few Nukes on you you can not fell much sympaty for him even afer 60 years. I newer saw anime where americans were good and main heroes. Just watch read or die and see main line of japanise people to the US.\\n\\nLol Gantz isnt racist and the Gantz creator isnt racist either, nor he dislikes American people. Theres only one reason why american and in general non-Japaneese people dont have much time in Gantz, its the same reason why there isnt a black guy in any other manga out there. Theres not many black people in Japan, Japan is not as diverse as the U.S, if you go in Japan you will see only Japaneese people, except of a few tourists, so the manga is created for the Japaneese audience and not for U.S audience or an international audience.\\n\\nWhy should they live in a Japanese manga??? Thats a messed up thing to say. They shouldn't have been included in the story in the first place. They were so out of place, but they were there nontheless. Oku Hiroya's not stupid, he knew exactly what he was doing. I overlooked Izumi's little stunt, but seriously, the Japanese need to chill on their gaijin stereotypes. Its like they have an inferiority complex or something, always making foreigners appear weaker or incompetent when compared to them.\\n\\nAnd Chocolove??? WTF!!!\\n\\nAt least the Hajime no Ippo manga put black people in a positive light. notably poor Mike Tyson.\",\n",

think I remember something about...\" \"Oh, my God, of course I remember.\" \"It was the most humiliating experience of my life.\" \"I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me, you know?\" \" Oh, can I have some of this?\" \" Sure.\" \"You know, I\\'m not myself when I\\'m around you.\" \"I\\'m usually so self-possessed and dignified, and...\" \"Ew, raisins.\" \"You should know, if I could ask you out...\" \"I would.\" \"You-you would what?\" \"Ask you out, on a date.\" \"I would ask you to go out.\" \"With who?\" \"Me.\" \"Me and you on a date.\" \"I like you.\" \"You do?\" \"Well, um, if you could ask me out and would, then I would say yes.\" \"But you probably already knew that, considering I already did say yes.\" \"So we both would...\" \"if we could.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So that\\'s good.\"

me.\" \"I am not doing this in front of people.\" \"Oh, crap.\" \"Here comes Lindsay.\" \"Get in the thing.\" \"Put your feet up.\" \"Put your feet...\" \"You embarrassed me and I deserve an apology.\" \"But you did steal that lipstick.\" \"I told you I just forgot to pay for it.\" \"You forget things, too.\" \"Now I want an apology.\" \"No.\" \"Dr. Berg told me to set boundaries.\" \"So

me, too.\" \"It\\'s too bad about that policy.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Is it a good policy?\" \"I guess, uh... we should go out separately.\" \"You want to go first?\" \"Um, actually, I have to use the...\"

In the fourth-quarter poll of 84 companies by the National Association for Business Economics found 42% of companies interviewed, ranging from manufacturing to finance, expect to boost jobs in the six months ahead. That’s up from 29% in the first three months of 2010. Only 7% in the latest survey predict they will shed jobs in the coming six months, down from 23% at the start of last year. Dow Jones\\n\\nFormer Reagan Administration adviser Bruce Bartlett would tend to disagree with the GOP’s effort to take credit for this one:\\n\\nAs usual, they are full of shit. The “tax cut” enacted in December was not a tax cut at all, merely the extension of tax cuts enacted in the early 2000s that were in effect all during the time the economy was shedding jobs by the millions. And even if there were some miracle properties in just extending tax cuts already in effect, it is grossly implausible to claim that this would have any impact on jobs so quickly.\\n\\nGuys, if you’re going to take credit for an economic turnaround, you might want to actually do something first.',\n",

There\\'s always something to write.\\n\\nThis blog also achieved 150k views earlier this month. This is a pretty nice improvement. This year has been great so far. Thanks to you, all of you readers and the bots. Without you this blog won\\'t get as far as this. Here\\'s to another year full of madness ramblings and shitty review of animu/manga/vidya~~!\\n\\nI want to write about The Walking Dead which is recently become one of my favorite series and because it\\'s fun to talk about. My first encounter with the franchise was when I stumbled upon the game titled \"The Walking Dead Episode 1\" around five months ago. The title made me interested but I still wasn\\'t sure what to expect. I found out it was developed by Telltale, which is one of the few developers that still actively developing games with adventure genre.\\n\\n\"So what?\" I thought, \"Probably it\\'s just a boring point \\'n click adventure just like those thousand adventure games created using AGS but with prettier graphics and maybe a bit zombies to spice it up\". Little did I know that \\'boring\\' was the most wrong word to describe The Walking Dead.\\n\\nI tried the game. My first impression was it kinda feels like those RPG that featured choices in the conversation, except without the RPG elements. But then it turns out to be more like an interactive movie. Interactive movie with a good story. Once I got to the story without wasting time I got absorbed to its world and I unconciously put myself into the main character\\'s shoes. Every choices you make will determine the course of the story. Sometimes it made me feel like a shit when I had to choose to save only one person and the other died horribly.\\n\\nOh yeah the story. So the story is like any other game with zombies, there\\'s suddenly a zombie outbreak in the city and you as the main character has to make your way to the safety zone. The difference is you are not a government agent with powerful arsenal shoved in your ass. You are not a guy who is trained to fight zombies. You don\\'t have any clue how to stop the infection. You\\'re just a run-of-the-mile guy who has to fight in order to avoid zombies eating your brain.\\n\\nBasically in this the-end-of-the-world scenario, your objective is to survive for another day. You must find a place to sleep, scavenge for food, and defend yourself against zombies or maybe other human. Also, you have a little girl to take care of. Some people in a certain image board jokingly called this game A Dad Simulator. That\\'s not pretty far off.\\n\\nThe game is divided into 5 parts each called an \"episode\". The choices you made during an episode will carry the effect to the next and so on. For myself, my favorite episodes are 2 and 3. The tension and emotional feeling in those episode are the best.\\n\\nJust recently I finished the last episode and got to the ending. It was yesterday, I found myself watching the credit roll with nearly watery eyes. Yes, it is one of those tearjerker ending. It also ended with a possibly sequel hook.\\n\\nI recommend this game to those who want a game with good 10-hour storyline. Do not expect complex gameplay because you won\\'t get it from this game. The graphics style is nice and works with the game overall, since it was based on comic books. It\\'s probably one of my favorite game in this year.\\n\\n(Oh yeah, I also follow the TV series. I already watched season 1 and 2, and still waiting for S3 to finish before starting it. I don\\'t like cliffhanger)\\n\\nIt\\'s over. After 110 episodes of space battles and political affairs, I finaly finished watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It is really, really great. Not even a second wasted in this show that I didn\\'t enjoy. It is definitely the very definition of classic masterpiece.\\n\\nThe Witch\\'s House (Majo no Ie) is a horror adventure game made with RPG Maker. It\\'s pretty much similar to another horror adventure game Ib, might as well call it Ib\\'s spiritual successor. Play it in the night with lights off.\\n\\nThe story follows Viola, a 13 year old girl who got lost in a forest on her way to her friend\\'s house. She found a house which is belong to a witch, hence the game\\'s title. I won\\'t spoil the plot but one thing: there is a twist at the true ending (there are two endings).\\n\\nThe game involves much more jump scare than Ib. I admit I was terrified several times, not only because the jump scare but also because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere in The Witch\\'s House is nicely done with the music and sound effects. Also, there\\'s much much more deaths in this game than Ib, which some of them are pretty gruesome.\\n\\nAnyone who likes Ib must try The Witch\\'s House. I\\'m not saying the latter is better than the former, they\\'re just similarly good and has similar experience too. I hope there will be many more games like this in the future. I can use a good scare once in a while.\\n\\nThe game is a freeware, made by Fummy in RPG Maker XV. The english translation was done by vgperson (she is also the one who translated Ib) and can be downloaded here. She also has a very cool tumblr.\\n\\nEvangelion 3.0 TL;DR Overview\\n\\n-SEELE throws Eva 01 into space, with a tang\\'d Shinji and Rei still inside\\n-They stay up there for 14 years\\n-Misato goes rogue, found her own organization to fix the world and recruits Asuka, Mari, and Touji\\'s younger sister, Asuka and Mari not aging because LCL exposure halts the aging process\\n-They save Unit 01 from space, but Shinji and Rei decide to go back to NERV where Gendou is still in charge, also he has Kaworu.\\n-Kaworu hits on Shinji while Rei disappears\\n-Kaworu thinks he found out a way to fix the world with magic spears and Lillith, he and Shinji team up and even combine their Evas\\n-Misato\\'s organization knows better and sends forth Asuka to stop them\\n-Kaworu and Shinji almost kill Asuka only to discover that SEELE tricked Kaworu and they really just started Instrumentality\\n-Kaworu explodes himself to stop it, making Shinji all sad and reducing everything to a red wasteland\\n-Asuka yanks Shinji out of his entry plug and holds his hand as they walk through the desert.\\n-Also Rei is also in the desert with them somehow.\\n\\nANNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\\n\\nCan\\'t wait for BDrip, or at least a camrip. It will be oh so glorious.sauce\\n\\nOkay, a Chuunikoi episode that focused on love letter and later a confession of a man. I expect it to be uninteresting but I was wrong. That confession scene reminds me of Onani Master Kurosawa. Haha.\\n\\nI saw a certain post on kz Livetune fanpage about writing a blog post with the theme \\'Tell the world about Livetune\\' so I guess I\\'ll try my luck. Not really up for contest or anything though, just want to share my love for Livetune.\\n\\nAs far as my experience with Vocaloid music goes, I\\'ve heard many great songs produced by various Vocaloid producers in many genres. All of these producers are talented men and women who pour all their hearts\\' content into the songs they are making. Some of them managed to grab my attention from the very first time I heard those songs sung by the virtual diva Hatsune Miku. They are ryo (supercell), minato, and of course kz (Livetune). I\\'ll talk about the former two in other time, for now I wish to tell you, the world, about Livetune.\\n\\nThat was in the mid year of 2009 when I sat in front of my computer, clicked some links I found on net. One of those links happened to be a download link to Vocaloid song compilations. I\\'ve already heard about this Vocaloid thing but all I knew was it just a program to make songs and I have never listened to one before.\\n\\nSo I proceed to download the file and unzipped it. Then I played all the songs available from the compilations. Those songs were all pretty awesome, some songs caught me in awe, such as Melt and Packaged. These songs just couldn\\'t get out of my head for a few days. So I ventured to find more of songs like those which I just listened to. Little did I know that it was the beginning of my long journey in the realm of Vocaloid.\\n\\nOther than Vocaloid songs, kz is also doing some songs for human singers. Probably the most popular collaboration is ClariS. Actually, kz was already made songs for them since they were still went by the name Alice & Clara. One song that I still remember dearly till this day is Kimi ni Yume wo Miyou. Other songs included Drop, irony and nexus.\\n\\nHe also contributed in a doujin album TamStar Records Collection Vol.0 which he composed two songs each sung by Yun*chi and Yanagi Nagi (God bless her). The song empty which sung by Nagi ended up in my top ten Nagi\\'s songs post which I made back then in 2011. Livetune\\'s first single Kocchi muite Baby/Yellow is a split single with another one of my favorite producer, ryo. Those two songs are the theme songs of 2nd Project Diva game.\\n\\nAt the beginning of this year, Livetune release another hit Tell Your World which was also the theme song of Google Chrome CM. The CM was phenomenal and it also served as a way to introduce Miku to the world. The song are very catchy yet it also has a deep meaning. It is probably my favorite kz song ever now. The more recent single with Miku on vocal is Weekender Girl which also very catchy. Another recent single is Transfer but this one is with Megumi Nakajima on vocal. The PV for this single is rather unique.\\n\\nThe things I like about kz Livetune\\'s songs are the upbeat tunes which usually are very catchy and easy to listen. However I also enjoy the slower one. Like I said my favorite song is Tell Your World but before it was Last Night Good Night. Whenever I listen to it, the song somehow always touches something in me especially on that high notes. Tell Your World made me feel like that too. I swear there are chills up my spine when I get to that part of the song.\\n\\nWell I could really go on and on about this matter however my hands are rather grew tired to type more so I\\'ll end this post right here. My goodness, now that I look at it this post is quite long for a mere fanboy\\'s rambling. Oh yeah, I think I\\'ll write about other Vocaloid producers in another time. A bit music post on this blog won\\'t hurt. Now I shall take my leave, if you excuse me.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the data gathered from this video is invaluable to humanity\\'s plan against BETA\\n\\nMuv-Luv Total Eclipse once again proved me that it is indeed the best comedy anime of the season. Alien where? Let\\'s go to onsen at once! Just forget for a second that humanity is doomed and there is a plan to annihilate mankind from the face of the earth on the way! Who cares about that when there are bunch of hot military babes in bikini in front of your eyes!\\n\\nNo wonder we are losing this war.\\n\\nThat was a pretty damn good episode. I kinda like the ending where Rikka didn\\'t suddenly become smarter and get a good score, but instead the overall score became lower. It\\'s more believable that way.\\n\\nI cracked myself up in the divorce scene between Yumeha and Touka. Kids these days are more mature than they used to be. Also, I didn\\'t expect Dekomori to be a prodigy kid type. Fortunately her above average brain doesn\\'t make her to be an annoying and cocky brat but instead a fun kid you like to play with. I\\'m not even a pedo.\\n\\nAnyway, the club is saved thanks to Yuuta\\'s effort. At least safe for now.\\n\\nWho in their right mind thinks it\\'s a good idea to start blogging an anime series starting from episode 4? I do. I am a faithful follower of \\'three episode rule\\', so everytime I want to judge whether any show is worth watching I watch three episodes of it first.\\n\\nSo yeah Chuunikoi. I\\'ve heard a lot of people talk about how bitch Nibutani in episode 4. Of course by \\'a lot of people\\' I mean a certain anime board from a certain imageboard. They described her like she just commited unpunished crime. They went rage or whatsoever over her behaviour. I was preparing to hate her when I started watching the episode. However things were different.\\n\\nI don\\'t find her act towards the chuunis akin to bitchness. I mean, she was a chuuni too several months ago. But now she grows up. A certain feeling of remorse and embarassment were left in its place. So it\\'s okay if she tries to hide her embarassing past to moves on with the flow of life. I rather find her to be more interesting in term of character when her past self as \\'Mori Summer\\' was revealed.\\n\\nNow with the cast of Chuuni characters completed, can we expect more hilarity and cuteness overload from Chuunikoi?\\n\\nYou want a post about Kara no Shoujo 2? Here, have this post about Kara no Shoujo 2.\\n\\nQuote from vndb:\\n\\nPrewar-era Japan.\\nDeep in the snowy mountains of northwestern Japan, there exists a settlement called Hitogata, the Village of Dolls. On the night of the festival honoring the clay idol Hinna-sama, a girl is murdered.\\nThe villagers all blame Hinna-sama\\'s curse. One outside the faith has joined in the festival of Hinna-sama, and brought the painful death of the curse down upon themself.\\n\\nOctober, Showa 32.\\nTwo years have passed since Touko Kuchiki\\'s abduction from her hospital room.\\nReiji Tokisaka\\'s younger sister saves a man who had tried to commit suicide.\\nHe, too, is the most recent victim of \"Hinna-sama\\'s curse\"——\\nAs the country moves ever closer toward war, Reiji Tokisaka begins his investigation, clinging desperately to the hope that Touko can be saved——\\nAnd at the same time, a strange religious group said to have dissolved six years ago begins to move again, to put a certain plan into motion——\\nThe curse will be carried out, whether by the gods or by human hands.\\n\\nIt is implied that the sequel takes place after True End of the first game. You know how that one ended right? It is confirmed that once again we will be assumed the role of Reiji. Some characters will make comeback as well.\\n\\nSo here\\'s what I expect from the sequel:\\n1. Touko.\\n2. More bizzare murders.\\n3. More suffering. Guaranteed.\\n4. More asshole antagonists. You know I genuinely hated the antagonists from the first one with every litre of my blood. I expect the same if not more from this.\\n5. Touko. The one and only perfect waifu material.\\n6. Everyone\\'s and their grandmas\\' favorite imouto Yukari is alive at the end of game. Who am I kidding.\\n7. English release. This is the most important. Although I can try (and of course failed) to read the japanese version with the help of software and a little piece of my brain cell, the experience is just not the same as reading the english one because of more understanding.\\n8. Did I mention Touko already?\\n\\nThe release date for Kara no Shoujo 2 is February 8th 2013. Let\\'s hope the world won\\'t end at December because I need to read this. For the time beings, have these teaser pictures.\\n\\nYE NOT GUILTY\\n\\nI\\'ve seen many negotiators in the past, they usually use all kind of dirty tricks up their sleeves to seal the deal. Enter Roger Smith, a negotiator AND a giant robot pilot. When his negotiation has gone awry, he calls a giant robot out of nowhere and punches things until everything goes the way he wants.\\n\\nThe Big O is what I called the bastard child of japanese anime and western cartoon tropes. It sets in fictional city which is pretty much a Film Noir New York City. Roger Smith is pretty much Bruce Wayne with giant robot. He pilots a Megadeus (name of the robot) and defeats monster of the week. When he\\'s not busy destroying the city, he is a gentleman who works as a negotiator. There\\'s also a deadpan android, Charlie\\'s Angel and a guy who loves tomato. But let\\'s just leave at that.\\n\\nWe have come to terms\\n\\nDespite the unexplainable ending, I like this show. See, I\\'ve never once find people talking about The Big O and I generally have no idea about this show except from what I read in the first volume of the manga (I have it in my collection). All I know about it were the neo-noir tone and Dorothy, the android girl. So I was really surprised when I found it pretty enjoyable. The plot at the end escaped me but the episodic content was the cream of the crop. Oh and one more thing, the soundtrack is lovely and so is the ending song. Overall I give this anime a solid 9/10.\\n\\nWhat happens when two male seiyuu play vidya together? A lot of laughter and dirty jokes. Especially if one of them is Tomokazu Sugita.\\n\\nTokyo Encounter is a show where two of my favorite seiyuu, Sugita and Yuuichi Nakamura, play video games together and eat snacks. They also do all kind of nonsense talk and there\\'s a segment in between transtition of one game to another in which they compete with each other in a challenge (e.g Guess from what game the playing music is). Sometimes they invite other seiyuu as well (even girls!) to play with them.\\n\\nThey play all kind of consoles and games from the old ones like NeoGeo or Famicom to the more recent one as well. The genre of the games they played varies from RPG, beat \\'em up, fightan, hell they even play Love Plus+ in that one episode. And Sugita seems pretty hardcore in Love Plus.\\n\\nSeriously, if you like Nakamura and Sugita, and you love video games, you have to watch Tokyo Encounter.',\n",

snacks.\" \"Do you like crackers with peanut butter on them?\" \"I hope it\\'s not too forward, coming over here.\" \"You\\'re a good kid, but...\" \"this isn\\'t really how I roll.\" \"OK?\"

wants to leave the lights on?\" \" You\\'re good at sex, right?\" \" I\\'m like a seven.\" \"I\\'m a nine.\" \"Now, look, take charge of the situation the second you walk in the room.\" \"Hey.\" \" I want to see you.\" \" Fantastic.\" \" What\\'s that scar from?\" \" I got knifed when I was a kid.\" \" Really?\" \" Nope, that\\'s from my C-section.\" \"What am I doing?\" \"All right, no more

times without you needing a nap, or pills or anything.\" \" How fun is that?\" \" Pretty fun.\" \"OK...\" \" Matt.\" \" Matt.\" \"I\\'m going to do something that I have not done in years.\" \"I told my husband that I hated it, but I don\\'t hate it, I love it.\" \" So what are you?\" \" Shh, shh, shh!\" \"Just watch.\" \" Mom?\" \" Oh, there\\'s my boy!\" \"You said you hated that.\" \"Hey!\" \"You\\'re not allowed to eat these anymore.\" \"All right, I\\'m so sorry.\" \"It\\'s just that lately I\\'ve been feeling like I\\'m gonna shrivel up and die if I just don\\'t get out there and start doing things.\" \"Obviously, by \"doing things,\" I don\\'t mean only things like what you saw...\" \"OK, we\\'re gonna talk about that later.\" \"OK, I may have to kill myself.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"You never called me back last night to tell me what happened.\" \"See, I used to be your best friend.\" \"But now my only option is to come here and listen to you share everything about your life with this idiot.\" \"She\\'s been here 40 minutes and that\\'s the nicest thing she\\'s said.\" \"We\\'re having grown-up talk.\" \"Go push Stan around the block.\" \"Stan?\" \"Is your

about now?\" \" But you and I had a plan, remember?\" \"We were gonna have stupid cookouts with our stupid husbands.\" \"Husbands are so stupid.\" \"Now I\\'m stuck at home, and you\\'re heading back

calling it.\" \"Still, there\\'s never an excuse for violence.\" \"Junior high kids are stealing your signs.\" \"Do you know why?\" \"\\'Cause they\\'re using them to pleasure themselves.\"

40-year-old woman?\" \"Whatever you do, you feel judged by the world, you feel judged by yourself.\" \"And if you ever, deep down, think you might get married again, you\\'re not going to.\" \"Not when you\\'re 50, and you can\\'t make babies anymore, and your looks have faded.\" \"So you put on a brave face and you try really hard not to think about the fact that maybe, maybe, this is all your life is ever gonna be.\" \"You know, my granddaddy got a chick pregnant when he was 90.\" \"Ahh!\" \"I think that they are going to buy.\" \"Thank God, \\'cause I really need the cash to do my face.\" \"How does this look?\" \" Like you\\'re skydiving.\" \" Really?\" \"Hey, nice pull with that hottie, sister.\" \"I may try and get on him myself tonight.\" \"You OK, sweetie?\" \"You having a little stroke?\" \"One time.\" \"I did it one time and I\\'m already one of them.\" \"Don\\'t spook him.\" \"Hey, little guy.\" \"Hurry!\" \"Hi.\" \"May I talk to your son?\" \" Robbie, there are some women here...\" \" Hi, Robbie.\" \"Hi.\" \"You obviously know my name.\" \" This is Laurie.\" \" Hey, Robbie.\" \"You\\'re fast.\" \"Robbie, do you know how embarrassing it can be to be a teenage boy?\" \" Yeah, I think I do.\" \" Well, it\\'s really rough on my son.\" \"What\\'s happening, little man?\" \"Dad.\" \"Hit the books.\" \"And I know it would probably be easier on him if I just hid out in the house.\" \"I mean, hell, that would make a lot of people happy.\" \"I think she\\'s home, but I\\'m not calling her first.\" \"Be nice to Jules.\" \"She\\'s all alone.\" \" And you\\'ve already won.\" \" I can\\'t believe I\\'m turned on.\" \"So what the hell am I supposed to do?\" \"I...\" \"I...\" \"You\\'re right, Robbie, we\\'re not gonna figure it out today, are we?\" \"All I know is, my son doesn\\'t like it when you boys take my signs.\" \"So you put the word out, okay?\" \"It\\'s over.\" \"You tortured that poor kid for me.\" \"Outstanding!\" \"Look, I\\'m gonna try really hard not to let my life make your life any more difficult, OK?\" \" I promise.\" \" Well, thank you.\" \"Seriously, thanks.\" \"Ryan\\'s picking me up, so I should...\" \" Bye.\" \" Bye.\" \"Or, you know, I could stay and hang with you if...\" \"Go.\" \"Have fun.\" \"Drive.\" \"He\\'s gone!\" \"So cool.\" \"OK, take the wine upstairs, get undressed.\" \" Wanna make sure the door\\'s locked.\" \" Want the lights on or off?\" \"No lights, I bought candles.\" \" Matthew, no more talking.\" \" All right.\" \"Sorry.\"',\n",
       " 'When I saw this story going around on Facebook this morning, several thoughts went through my head. First and foremost, obviously, I thought it was an April Fools joke. And then for a brief moment I was like, wait — men definitely can’t lactate, right? Has science come up with a way? Male nipples are just for decoration, everybody knows that. And then finally I realized that this was the sort of viral campaign that’s practically made for Facebook which are both the reasons why Upworthy is a thing and the teenagers are fleeing.\\n\\nAt any rate, Project Breastfeeding was started by Hector Cruz, who, when his wife gave birth to their baby daughter, experienced discrimination when it came to public breastfeeding, so he started the project as a campaign to educate men and remove the stigma. I’m not so much weirded out by women breastfeeding in public — I mean, a kid’s got to eat, right? — so much as I am by imagery that evokes babies sucking on men’s nipples. I understand what he’s trying to do here and it’s commendable and everything, but at the same time kill it with fire.',\n",
       " 'MaureenW\\n\\nTrump being taken for a ride …. don’t know that I would agree with that. I think you’ll find that when the US gets to investigating the Clinton Foundation and pay to play, and Obama’s parting gift to Iran, some of those mentioned in the Saudi purge will be in the news again.\\n\\nGezza\\n\\nNonsense. It’s a setup. The Saudis are worried about Iran having too much power & influence in the region, & the potential for them to appeal even to ordinary Sunnis in Saudi Arabia to get rid of their dodgy Wahabbi aristocrats. The Saudi Crown Prince is a numpty who’s totally botching the war in Yemen, so he obviouslyy hope to suck Bibi & Trump in to sort out Iran for them – which will be necessary as Iran’s troops & their allies like Hezbollah troops in Syria & Iraq’s Shiite militias in Iraq would cream their mob. Bibi’s happy to go along with this con job, I reckon, for now. It’s all been well-discussed by experts on Aljaz this morning.\\n\\nGezza\\n\\nGezza\\n\\nAnd didn’t the Saudis close all the US bases and kick the Americans out because they weren’t very popular with their people? And didn’t they then set up their biggest base in the Middle East in Qatar? And aren’t the Saudis now making trouble for Qatar and complaining that they have an embassy for the Taliban there amongst other things? And didn’t the Emir of Qatar (a very intelligent, articulate, reasonable-sounding man) just recently point out the Americans asked them to do that so they could engage with the Taliban there? And aren’t the Saudis now stirring up shit about Qatar? For no good reason?\\nAnd didn’t Tehran just -recently reject Ahmadinejad and re-elect a moderate President who has been prepared to negotiate with the EU and the US – but now Israel & the Saudis have persuaded the US Chief Twitter Doofus to join them in threatening them again? It’s all very confusing, especially when the Saudis are involved.\\n\\nGezza\\n\\nIt’s bloody 2am there’s a howling gale i reckon about 178.27 kph (roughly) I’ve had to rescue two chairs from my patio before they were blown over the fence into the stream & it’s pelting with rain! It’s coming from the North! This better not have anything to do with YOU, Wilkinson! 😡\\n\\nGezza\\n\\nAlan Wilkinson\\n\\nNah, balmy up here, Sir Gerald. Light zephyrs and a bit of needed moisture now and then. Brilliantly timed my dog walk this morning between a couple of showers but all peaceful now. Listening to the wekas squawking in the garden. Feasting on worms I think.\\n\\nMaureenW\\n\\nMissy\\n\\nWhere to start on recent shenanigans in UK / Europe, so much is happening, much of it more of the same so to speak, but a few things are bubbling along and are becoming bigger than perhaps they deserve.\\n\\nSo, first up, Catalan update. Spain issued a European Arrest Warrant for the exiled President of Catalonia. This has gained some criticism within Europe – mainly from Eurosceptics – as the European Arrest Warrant was only meant to be used for the deportation of serious criminals and terrorists, not political dissidents. Puigdemont and four of his Ministers handed themselves over to the Belgian Police on Sunday, at a hearing on Sunday Evening a Belgian judge released them while the case is reviewed, they must remain in Belgium. This is interesting as my understanding is that when an arrest warrant is issued then the individual should be arrested and returned to the country that has issued the warrant, not treated as an extradition, so the fact the Belgians didn’t just return them to Spain could mean that they are not happy with the turn of events, it could also mean that my understanding of an EU arrest warrant is lacking.\\n\\nSecond up, it seems both the Liberal Democrats and Labour may be preparing for another election. The Chief of Staff to the Liberal Democrats Leader has resigned to (in her words) concentrate on campaigning and preparing as the candidate for Richmond (she won a by election in Richmond last year and lost her seat in June). The local party committee however don’t seem to be as pleased that she has assumed she would be the candidate. Labour have appointed a new campaigns manager, a Momentum activist who, in 2006, was convicted of electoral fraud. Not a good look for Labour considering the controversy around electoral fraud in the GE in June where it was alleged Labour activists and electoral officials told students they could vote twice, not to mention electoral fraud in the Borough of Tower Hamlets (a Labour council) involving double voting within the Muslim community, and the threats to Muslim voters from a Labour candidate.\\n\\nThird. Boris is in trouble, now I like Boris, but after the last few days I am thinking he cannot survive in his current position, at best he has been irresponsible, at worst he has outright lied. A British Iranian woman is in jail in Iran, to be honest I am not sure what she was arrested for originally, but she was there on holiday. Boris has been working with the Embassy on her case, and said that she had been teaching journalism in Iran (which is apparently illegal), though her family said that she was there on holiday. After he made his comments she was taken back into court and Boris’s comments were cited as new evidence to apply to increase her sentence. Boris may, or may not, have been correct, but he should never have said it publicly. If he was correct it was irresponsible of him to say it and put her at risk further, if the family are correct then he outright lied. He obviously has information and so it is possible there may have been some truth to his comments, and that the family are possibly lying to protect her, but as I said it was irresponsible of him to put it in the public domain. It shows a lack of judgement on his part, something which can be funny and charming when dealing with friendly nations and light stuff, but on something like this a lack of judgement can have catastrophic consequences.\\n\\nFourth. Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, has apparently been meeting with Israeli Government Ministers – and the Israelis PM – whilst on holiday in Israel. The meetings have not been sanctioned by the Foreign Office, nor has the PM been made aware of the meetings. The PM had dinner with the Israeli PM the other night to celebrate the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, and was apparently still in the dark at that time about Patel’s meetings with him on other matters, including (allegedly) using UK aid money for the Israeli Army.\\n\\nThese two incidences have put Theresa May under enormous pressure to sack them, this is not what she needs on top of the sex scandal just weeks out from the Autumn Budget.\\n\\nMissy\\n\\nThere is a lot happening at the moment as things ramp up a bit before the Christmas recess, I think the Catalan stuff will fade into the background for a bit until the election in 21 December, but things in the UK are just going to get messier I think.\\n\\nToday there are reports that Priti Oatel had at least two more unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials, one in London and one in New York. The pressure is on May to sack her.\\n\\nMissy\\n\\nThe ‘Pestminster’ scandal is spreading, and has resulted in a suicide.\\n\\nJust over a week ago a spreadsheet was released listing 36 Conservative MPs that were involved in inappropriate behaviour – according to some young staffers in Westminster. The problem with the spreadsheet (based on what was reported) is none of the behaviour was either serious or illegal, most involved misjudged passes, or drunken ‘jokes’ and comments, some included consensual relationships – both extramarital and between single MPs. However, this created a flood of other complaints, including one young Labour activist who claimed she was raped by another activist and told not to report it by a senior member of the Labour Party.\\n\\nA number of MPs, both Conservative and Labour have been referred for internal investigation, one Labour MP had the whip suspended during the internal investigation, one Conservative MP was referred to the police and had the whip suspended. None of these MPs have been told what the allegations against them are, and the Conservative MP found out from the news as the Party did not even tell him he had been referred to the police and suspended, but rather leaked it to media instead.\\n\\nAs I reported last week Michael Fallon resigned his ministerial position. It seems that Fallon has form for making unwanted passes at women, and also he was known for sexist comments and jokes. It appears that none of Fallon’s misdemeanours were illegal, but rather just opened him up to the possibility of blackmail which put him in a vulnerable position regarding the clearances required as Defence Secretary. It has been reported that May was told about Fallon by Leadsom, who has leadership ambitions, and it was Leadsom’s revelations to May that forced him to resign. However, Leadsom has not come out of this squeaky clean, as leader of the house she was reportedly aware of sexual harassment of young staffers by senior MPs, but did nothing about it.\\n\\nLabour and the Lib Dems have not been completely free from allegations.\\n\\nAs well as the rape complaint mentioned earlier, a Labour MP reportedly sexually harassed a young staff member by rubbing his crotch against her and sending lewd text messages, she reported it. The MP was spoken to, and the activist was told it would be dealt with. The leaders office was told in January 2016, however, the MP in question was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet shortly after.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat activists have set up a Reddit page which they can anonymously leave their experiences, among those left are accusations of rape in which the party covered up. This hasn’t been reported very widely, and the Lib Dems are very much ducking anything to do with what has been dubbed the Pestminster scandal.\\n\\nIt has also spread, last week a complaint of inappropriate sexual behaviour was made against a member of the Welsh Assembly, he was not told what the nature of the complaint was, but categorically denied any inappropriate behaviour. Today the member of the Assembly committed suicide. His suicide has prompted some, (but not all as many are seeing it was proof of guilt), to look at the issue of trial by media / social media, the twitter mob (a modern day lynch mob), and people being convicted in the court of public opinion based on hearsay and erroneous allegations.\\n\\nThe leaders of all parties have called for something to be done on harassment and bullying in Westminster, and interestingly Corbyn has been one of the most vocal, bringing accusations of hypocrisy considering he happily (albeit many decades ago) showed off a naked Dianne Abbott in his flat for ‘liberal credentials’, but worse has done nothing about the Shadow Chancellor who, several years ago, called on a Female Conservative MP to be lynched, and more recently, suggested that Conservative MPs and their families should be harassed and hounded wherever they go which resulted in Labour activists trying to find out where one MP lived and his children went to school (they don’t, they are too young) so that they could go and harass them and hound them.\\n\\nMissy\\n\\nIt seems one person was shot with non life threatening injuries, the university was in lockdown but that has since been lifted, the gunman is on the run, the gunman is described as a black man in khaki trousers, grey hoodie, carrying an automatic weapon.\\n\\nMissy\\n\\nThe Austrian President elect, Sebastian Kurz, is in coalition talks with the far right party, Freedom Party (FPO), a well known EU sceptic party. It has been reported that FPO politicians demanded that Kurz appoint either the Finance Minister or Foreign Minister from their ranks or the coalition talks will collapse.\\n\\nIt has been reported this morning that Norbet Hofer of the FPO party has been appointed Foreign Minister. This is a blow for the EU on more than one front.\\n\\nFirst, Mr Hofer is an outspoken critic of the EU, and has repeatedly attacked the EU over Immigration, Economic, and Security Policies.\\n\\nSecond, this appointment is clearly a slap in the face of Jean Claude Juncker who has previously expressed his wish to isolate and impose sanctions on far right and populist Governments, and made it clear in 2016 that Mr Hofer would have been frozen out of any discussions in the EU if he had won the Austrian Presidential election then.\\n\\nThird, Mr Hofer could use his position to influence other EU member states to oppose Mr Juncker’s plans for a single tax system, one Finance Minister, and an EU army.\\n\\nAll in all things may have gotten a little sticky for the EU and Mr Juncker.',\n",

       " 'Twitter and reddit are the modern day Colosseum, and no one wants to watch gladiators hug\\n\\nFormer CEO of reddit Yishan Wong has posted a comment at reddit, defending Chairman Pao and insisting that we have her, and reddit all wrong. Wong denies that reddit was ever intended to be a ‘bastion of free speech’ on the internet, a refrain picked up by incoming CEO Steve Huffman (spez), one of the original creators of reddit.\\n\\nNeither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen: These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time. We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.\\n\\nI am much more familiar with Twitter than I am with reddit, and in my opinion, neither of them understand their platforms and how people use them. Jack Dorsey at Twitter and Steve Huffman at reddit created their tools to prompt communication, and lots of people do use them for that sole purpose, but plenty of others use it to watch the wars break out – some retard shitposting and getting an epic smackdown is exactly what makes reddit and Twitter fun. Twitchy.com has built their entire site by collecting the best facepalms, smackdowns, comebacks and bitchslaps Twitter has to offer. Twitchy gets Twitter, while Twitter seems oblivious. Reddit’s built-in downvoting and upvoting performs the same function. Open a reddit thread and you will instantly see who is winning the war of public opinion.\\n\\nOn both reddit and Twitter, no one has to view content they don’t wish to see. Twitter users do not have to see their mentions – what other people are saying about them, if they don’t wish to. No one is forced to browse subreddits they find distasteful or offensive. But on both platforms, people go looking for trouble, because trouble is part of what makes the sites fun and engaging. Don’t want to battle? Don’t browse subreddits and shitpost in the comments, don’t tweet shit using hashtags you don’t like. It’s very simple. Both sites are arenas where ideas compete. Tweeting a hashtag is equivalent to throwing down the gauntlet – it’s how you spoil for a fight. And get one. No one has to fight, but if you dish shit out, you better plan on taking it right back.\\n\\nWhat’s actually happening on both sites is that crybabies will shitpost in hashtags or subreddit comments and then run away crying when the fight they deliberately picked starts. Check the #WomenAgainstFeminism hashtag, for example. Random users will tweet ‘abuse’, calling these women stupid, illiterate, dumb, attention-whores, ignorant, compare them to slaves or dogs, and then add the hashtag. When users in that hashtag respond to the shitposter, it’s ‘harassment’ and ‘abuse’. And Twitter backs the suckholes who start fights and then run away crying when they get the shit beat out of them, metaphorically, of course.\\n\\nreddit is now heading down the same path, and contemplating banning subreddits that other users of reddit object to. The actual users of the subreddits are perfectly happy, and no user is forced to browse any subreddit they don’t like. Don’t think /fatpeoplehate is funny? Don’t go there. You’ll note that /fatpeoplehate was banned, while /skinnypeoplehate is still up and running. reddit is right to ban content that is illegal (revenge porn, etc.), but in banning content that is perfectly legal but objectionable to some people, they are profoundly misunderstanding the function and value of their site, and completely disrespecting their core users.\\n\\nThey can, and will revolt.\\n\\nBoth reddit and Twitter are giving in to feminists and SJWs who are, in actual fact, destroying their core business. Both will completely collapse if they allow the hugbox to exist. When no one ever gets offended by anything ever, the site is boring as shit and it dies. I have zero sympathy for them. Welcome to Capitalism 2.0: you don’t tell the customers what they need, you give them what they want. Or you die. C’est la guerre.\\n\\nIt just so happens that I have former CEO Dick Costolo’s personal email address at home, Jack Dorsey’s address at Twitter, and the address of his primary admin. I sent them a little note explaining how Twitter works, which you can read in its entirety at The Ralph Retort. I copied Ralph on the note, and he rather liked it! Will it have any effect? Dunno. I’d say I threw down a gauntlet.',\n",
       " 'Xfce\\'s Early April Fool\\'s Joke\\n\\nby Ostatic Staff - Jan. 21, 2012\\n\\nI saw a post on the Xfce blog Tuesday or Wednesday about changing versioning scheme of the next Xfce release. I saved the URL knowing that I\\'d want to write about it. Just thank goodness that a storm blew in and caused my computer to shut off. Otherwise, I might have never seen the Update 2. Dirty rats.\\n\\nThe Update 2 was a link to post on the Xfce mailing list post where Stephan Arts explained (and thoroughly enjoyed, btw) it was an early April Fool\\'s joke, and I fell for it. The clue was supposed to be the final release date scheduled for April 1. I noticed it, but still didn\\'t take the post as joke until I clicked the Update link. In fact, here\\'s what my post almost was:\\n\\nThe Xfce developers (and interested parties) have been discussing the version scheme of their popular light-weight desktop environment. They are rapidly approaching 4.10, but that particular number could cause some upgrade issues. So, what\\'s a project to do?\\n\\nThe problem with 4.10 is that developers view that as \"4.1 with an extra decimal for precision.\" But 5.0 would confuse users thinking the desktop has taken some big jump forward - or as Stephan Arts said, \"we pulled a ‘gnome-3′ on them.\" A hexadecimal system was discussed but quickly dismissed. So, again, what to do?\\n\\nWell, they (the Xfce team) decided that the \".\" could be viewed as a thousands separator as in Europe. Looking at it that way would give one Xfce 4,008 and Xfce 4,010. This would also allow them to put off 5.0 for \"another 990 years.\"\\n\\nSo, the next major release will be Xfce 4010. Xfce 4010pre1 is scheduled for February 12, 4010pre2 should arrive around March 11, and pre3 is expected on March 25. Xfce 4010 should be released on April Fool\\'s Day.\\n\\nAgain, Stephan, you are a dirty rat. :D\\n\\nThe next version of Xfce will be 4.10 after all. ppppffth!',\n",
       " 'Well, it was bound to happen anyway. As one Facebook commenter put it, \"They were responding to a call they got in the goddamn \\'90s.\" I\\'m talking about W___ S____, a South Phoenix storage unit turned underground show space that\\'s been hosting shows for nearly two decades -- and was finally broken up by the police on its final night.\\n\\nMaybe we can mention the venue name anyway, since it\\'s not really much of a secret at this point (thanks, Google) and of course, the cops are keen now. But I\\'d rather not, just because this \"venue\" tends to get passed down like a DIY-scene heirloom, and I respect the few shreds of anonymity we\\'re allowed in this post-Snowden era. Saturday night was supposed to be the venue\\'s final night, unless someone else took it over. When I asked one of the organizers what was next, that person shrugged, saying, \"No one knows yet.\"\\n\\nWe arrived a little after 9 p.m. to a street lined with cars, but the space was completely darkened. People stood around in the dim light, holding hushed conversations, like this was some kind of dark vigil. Maybe it was. I couldn\\'t make out anyone\\'s faces, so I ended up standing by the dumpster, chain-smoking cigarettes and waiting for the second band, Stressors, to finish setting up. I missed the first gig, but was eager to see Destruction Unit, Gay Kiss, and especially Sleep Money, which I hadn\\'t heard in over a year.\\n\\nFrom San Diego, Stressors were a pretty decent hardcore group with a really large guy for a singer. I\\'m being kind -- he was pretty obese. But that just made him more fun while he thrashed about as some kids threw firecrackers into the crowd. This pissed off this round, screaming fellow, who spat and said he\\'d had more fireworks than that thrown at him. \"Only two more songs left,\" he growled. \"But if you don\\'t care, there\\'s the fucking door.\"\\n\\nHe was, of course, reacting to the low level of energy in the humid, smelly room. I don\\'t have much to say about the music except it was loud and made me want to punch things. For the last song, a small semblance of a mosh pit broke out, but it was pretty much over as soon as it began. The mic was thrown down and everyone filed outside to smoke in the dark again. That\\'s when the Stressors frontman went to his own merch booth and angrily started snapping his band\\'s vinyl 7-inchers in half.\\n\\nSoon after that, the cops rolled up. I\\'d spotted them earlier when we first arrived; plus, some security vehicles kept cruising by, but they both left eventually, so I wasn\\'t sure what to make of it. I guess they came back. The crowd collectively sighed and the officers marched around, demanding to know who was in charge. As a reflexive precaution, I pulled my memory card from my camera and hid it on my person, neglecting to get any shots of the patrol cars. According to one musician, his guitarist was shoved and intimidated by the cops, but I didn\\'t see any hassles. The cops basically told everyone to GTFO and so we did.\\n\\nYou could cut the disappointment with a butter knife. As one person on Facebook put it, \"Always disappointing when from the perspective of law enforcement: some people standing around watching bands in a storage space is prioritized over, literally, ANYTHING ELSE that is going on [out there]. Was really looking forward to the rest of that show.\" I couldn\\'t agree more.\\n\\nA monsoon storm was rolling in and would soon prove to be one of the most destructive gales of the season. With nothing else to do, we went to Lost Leaf. I bumped into Hotrock Supajoint, who told me he\\'d just finished a set at Joe\\'s Grotto before the power went out, so with nothing else to do, he came there.\\n\\nAfter all that, I wasn\\'t really in the mood to drink in a bar, so my friends and I killed a 12-pack or two in the street. It rained heavily, so I put my camera away and didn\\'t get any more shots of the night. Instead, we let the warm rain rain soak us and watched the lightning dancing across the valley, clapping, cheering and whooping whenever the sky burst brightly. Maybe that\\'s dumb, but we were drunk and it felt like what people used to do before fireworks were invented.\\n\\nWe went back in the bar in time to see Andy Warpigs begin his set. Personally, I think he killed it, but I might be biased. Andy has been a friend of mine for a while now, ever since I first heard him cover \"The KKK Took My Baby Away\" on ukulele at a house show. He played that cover again, much to my delight. When he learned it was a drunken girl\\'s birthday, he began chanting \"Happy birthday motherfucker, hell yeah, smoke weed,\" until Supajoint heard him, rushed onstage and the two sang Hotrock\\'s song together. Andy was also joined by Bbieu for \"Everybody Likes You Now\" and a few other songs.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to talk too much about my friend\\'s performance, because it speaks for itself, but I think everyone found the best alternative for the night in spite of everything being ruined, either by storms or bored public enforcers.

       " 'Argh, my spine is bent!\\n\\nTag Archives: eject disc problem\\n\\nThe PS4 is the most terrible piece of garbage I have ever had the horror to experience. This thing is bottom of the barrel trash. And I am dumbfounded that there isn’t more of an uproar about it on the internet. Sony is an absolute disgrace in every way, and I will never buy another product from them again.\\n\\nWhy, you ask? On boxing day 2014, I saw that EB Games were having a sale on Sony PlayStation 4. They were including 5 games in a bundle that was slightly better value than before christmas. I’d been thinking about getting the PS4 for a while so I decided it was time, I figured I’d spoil myself, get together all of my Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) games and console take it in to trade them, and walk home with a brand new shiny console for hours of entertainment.\\n\\nI should be honest, I don’t actually play console games much at all. I’ve had a console of some sort for the last 20 years+ of some sort or another, including NES, Sega Master System, Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, and most recently PS3. I came to a realisation a few years ago that my interest in console games had completely waned. I only play once in a blue moon, or if a friend comes round we might have a laugh with some Grand Theft Auto carnage.\\n\\nI also have come to believe that PC gaming is far superior than console gaming in every way.\\n\\nI actually always hated the PS3 OS and the interface. I found it ugly, clunky, and just shit. The load time, system updates, and everything about it just feels terrible. The only reason I have ‘stuck’ with Sony is because I didn’t want to support Microsoft in the gaming world.\\n\\nSo I wasn’t extremely excited about the PS4, I more just wanted to get it to upgrade to the latest version. I figured I could get rid of my old PS3 which was the 60GB version – that was the very loud, very large, dust collecting, backwards compatible console (that I never ONCE played a ps2 game on). Also when I say “loud” I mean, this thing sounded like a plane was taking off under my TV. This thing was also as heavy as a fucking car. I’m not exaggerating. If you kicked this piece of shit as hard as you could, it would break your foot and not affect it in any way.\\n\\nI also figured it would be a good “media centre” update as well, I’d be able to watch movies on it just as I could on my PS3, but being the latest version, obviously it would be even better.\\n\\nSo I went into the store and traded in 11 PS3 games and my console, I was offered a measly $90 trade in value – a bit of a kick in the guts, but I continued onwards.\\n\\nThe pre-pubescent, pimply faced sales kid told me that “You have to pay to access the PlayStation Network. You have to pay to play online at all”. I stopped. My jaw dropped\\n“Are you fucking serious?” (There are about 30-40 people in queue, close by & listening in a boxing day rush).\\n“I know, that was my first reaction too, but <13 yo sales guy pitch here>“.\\n“That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard”.\\n\\nReally, Sony charging for access to their online world is SO fucking outrageous it is disgusting. They have the worst online network, it’s been HACKED numerous times, it’s down all the time, it’s just inferior to EVERY alternative in EVERY way. Just using PC games you have a FAR wider audience, and way cheaper entry.\\n\\nAlas I’d come this far, so I continued.\\n\\nThen the rodent sales guy asks if I want a second controller:\\n“Sure” I said.\\n“Oh but it doesn’t come with a cable.”\\n“… Wait… What? Did you just say… the controller… doesn’t come… with a cable? I… I just… How?”\\n“Nope haha, I recommend you buy this docking station power charger too so you can charge them both. That way you don’t need to have the console turned on to charge the controllers. The controllers die really quickly because of their led display”\\n“That sounds… Really terrible. How could they not include a cable? Don’t they just use the normal USB/micro USB cables? Don’t worry, I already have them”\\n“Oh no they don’t use those cables” (they do)\\n“Can you just sell me a normal cable?”\\n“Sure. Oh wait, we don’t have any left sorry”\\n“Oh god…”\\n\\nSo after being forcefully up-sold with Sony’s shamefully terrible products and non existent business ethics, I continued.\\n\\nEventually after further disappointment being told I couldn’t trade any of the ‘bundled’ games for less shit games, I walked out of there having spent way more than I expected, and feeling absolutely terrible about the whole ordeal.\\n\\nSo I got home, plugged it all in, went to enter my account/profile details and connect to PlayStation Network. ERROR. That’s right, the PlayStation Network was down. The “online” network that Sony have the arrogant nerve to think they can charge for, was not accessible on christmas, or the next 3-4 days – the peak holiday time, when the entire PlayStation world would have been wanting to play. You couldn’t come up with a more ridiculous story – really. They are just a fucking laughing stock.\\n\\nTurns out it was due to constant DDOS attacks. I’m not going to go into the reasons etc (google it), but I have to be honest, I’m GLAD that they got attacked. They deserve to be absolutely caned for their disgusting service. Having said that, if they’re going to charge for their pathetic appalling network, they are OBLIGED to have better security security, backup measures and alternative plans for these situations, otherwise what the fuck do they deserve our money for?\\n\\nSo far everything about this piece of shit was just terrible. For days I tried entering in my credentials (the console doesn’t save your email address/password, so every single time I had to re-enter it again using the painfully slow controller/keyboard method – just a small example of why the playstation UI sucks). But after a few days the network finally came back online. I tried to connect, ERROR. I googled it – and Sony’s genius engineering team advised “reboot your machine” (fucking idiots). I rebooted my machine, it did nothing. I still got an error. Eventually I found an obscure manual network setting adjustment which was NOT specified by Sony but rather some clever punter. Finally I was online.\\n\\nAfter exploring some of the options/settings I was baffled as to why there is so much focus placed on social networking and sharing etc. As if anyone cares about sony and their social media – these guys are completely deluded.\\n\\nAnyway I played GTA5 a few times. It was as lacklustre as it was on the PS3, but now some of the voices and sounds seemed to come out of the controller. I don’t find this adds ANY immersion whatsoever – it’s actually confusing, and to be honest I’d rather it just not happen, with the benefit of a longer battery life for the shithouse controllers.\\n\\nFinally a few days later I had a friend coming around and we were going to settle in and watch a movie, so I grabbed my USB with a legally obtained video to watch, and plugged it into the console. Only to discover that the PS4 is unable to play ANY videos copied onto it via USB or any other means. I could not believe it. A major part of my reason to have a console at all was to act as a ‘media centre’. I didn’t even bother to look up this functionality because I just assumed it would be included – why wouldn’t it? I was absolutely dumbfounded and disgusted. What an outrage. I was also stabbing my own eyes with forks in frustration.\\n\\nOn googling responses on the internet I found a range of varied opinions. But as with all gaming topics, you have these strange retarded ‘fanbois’ who stand by their console/platform/game/developer of choice no matter how much they are blatantly and obviously not living up to expectations.\\n\\nAt this stage I just find the whole thing comical. To wrap it up – if you haven’t bought a PS4 yet, don’t do it. Just don’t. It’s a fucking piece of shit. I’ll sign off with a concise list.\\n\\nWhy the PS4 is shit\\n\\nOverly expensive\\n\\nYou have to pay to access the PlayStation Network (to play any online games)\\n\\nYou can’t play any videos copied to the console. It’s no longer ANY use as a media center.\\n\\nNo flash support on the browser at all\\n\\nSecond controllers don’t come with cables.\\n\\nTerrible wide impacting bug where the unit will beep and spit out discs randomly for no reason, in mid game or will even try when discs aren’t in there. Sony encourage users to send units back for repair.\\n\\nShit games.\\n\\nThe PlayStation Network was down over the peak holiday period.\\n\\nSony’s security is known to be appalling, and is a laughing stock worldwide. Peoples sensitive private information has been hacked many times.\\n\\nSony’s OS and UI are fucking terrible.\\n\\nThe physical console is eye hurtingly ugly.\\n\\nThe buttons on the unit are pathetic – hard to press, impossible to see the icons on the buttons.\\n\\nThe “improvements” of this console are almost all SHIT. The controller voices/audio/lights are just battery wasting gimmicks. The focus on “social networking” and “sharing” is just rubbish that no-one cares about.\\n\\nThe community is terrible.\\n\\nYou can NEVER, EVER ever change your gamertag/PSN Name.\\n\\nNo release button for ejecting stuck discs. Instead it has a retarded loose “not normal” screw that is almost impossible to see, requires opening the machine and even then impossible to get at\\n\\nMuch, much more.\\n\\nI’d love to hear your feedback or experiences. Thanks.\\n\\nEDIT (November 2015):\\nSony you had one job to do!! Let us put in a game and play the game. But no, Sony can’t even build a unit that is able to load a disc and play the disc without RANDOMLY spitting it out! There is a widely known bug with the console where it will randomly just start spitting out the disc in mid game. Or even if there is no disc in the console, it will sit there beeping TRYING to eject it. What the fuck? Seriously. Is it too much to ask this hideous piece of rubbish to not break across the board? Really – is that being greedy? I am absolutely baffled that this unit is so shit. But if that’s not enough, listen to Sony’s suggested fix – they say to turn it off and on again. (Wow, thanks Sony). And if that doesn’t work, send it in for repair! That is unacceptably outrageous! We don’t want to have to pack this thing up in safe packaging, pay for shipping to send it off, and then be without a PS4 for WEEKS – FUCK YOU! But worse still, if you look online you’ll find there is usually a repair you can do yourself (thanks for lying Sony). You open the top of the unit, that’s right, you actually have to pull the ugly thing apart by wrenching the top off revealing the disgusting innards, then there is a hidden screw – I mean it’s almost impossible to see, and you need a very thin long screwdriver to access it (which you’re unlikely to have), and then you need to turn it clockwise “a few times”… But it’s not a “normal” screw; it’s some weird loose piece of shit that doesn’t actually tighten. Couldn’t you have just used a goddamn button you utter retards? Incredibly after breaking apart my piece of shit and ramming screwdrivers into “not normal screws” and tightening the non-tightening screw, this actually worked for me. Fuck you PlayStation 4.',\n",
       " 'Self-proclaimed paranormalist Uri Geller, the famously debunked “psychic” who “predicted” Donald Trump‘s 2016 victory because he has 11 letters in his name, has found a new way to get attention.\\n\\nHe says he will “telepathically” stop British Prime Minister Theresa May from following through with Brexit.\\n\\nHe plans to transmit his psychic energy into May’s brain at the “very mystical time” of 11.11 in the morning and evening every day from a secret location near his home in Israel. He will visualise her signing a document revoking article 50 and, separately, he will also visualise her deciding to hold a second referendum — but this, he says, is his “second choice”. … He has already successfully penetrated May’s mind, he added, when she visited his home three years before she became prime minister. “I bombarded her mind to be the prime minister — and she became the prime minister,” he said.\\n\\nUh-huh… sure. These so-called “psychics” all work the same way. Geller plans to take credit if Brexit doesn’t occur — pay no mind to the million people who marched against Brexit yesterday — and he’ll come up with some rationalization if Brexit ever happens. And his predictions are crazy enough — and his lies so brazen — that they’re bound to get media attention.\\n\\nThe Guardian published two articles about his claims in two days, without a single voice of reason in either one. That’s a disservice to readers, who deserve at least one sensible voice in each piece saying he’s full of shit.\\n\\nIt’s telling that the man who claims he has the power to stop Brexit did absolutely nothing about it in 2016 when the vote occurred. Imagine having the mental power to change the course of Brexit but allowing the nation to go through three years of chaos first before letting everyone in on your abilities.\\n\\nThe Guardian didn’t mention that either.\\n\\n(via Dispatches From the Culture Wars.

       " 'One of the best tactics so-called researchers have used to conclude that fully one-fifth of college women will be sexually assaulted is to vastly expand the definition of what it is.\\n\\nA new study, conducted at Rutgers University, relies heavily on this tactic to stoke fear and encourage witch hunts of college men across the country.\\n\\nReason\\'s Elizabeth Nolan Brown dissects the study, noting the definition of \"sexual assault\" and \"sexual violence\" included everything from \"remarks about physical appearance\" and \"persistent sexual advances that are undesired by the recipient\" to \"threats of force to get someone to engage in sexual behavior, as well as unwanted touching and unwanted oral, anal, or vaginal penetration or attempted penetration.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s an ocean of difference between someone saying you look good today and someone physically pinning you down against your will. To include both under the category of \"sexual assault\" is just ludicrous, and certainly not a serious way of studying the issue.\\n\\n\"So what have we really learned here?\" Nolan Brown asked. \"That one in four female undergrads experienced something between rape and catcalls before coming to Rutgers; one in five female Rutgers undergrads experienced something between forced vaginal penetration and unwanted kissing at the hands of another student-or-not-student, somewhere in the universe, since starting college; three percent of students were perhaps physically threatened, perhaps mildly pressured into sexual activity; and four percent of students have been subject to something between forced oral, vaginal, or anal penetration and an unwanted caress while they were either asleep, totally passed out, or had had a few beers.\"\\n\\nThe Rutgers study comes on the heels of a new University of Oregon study also purporting to show that one in five college women have been victimized. That study is based a similar 2014 study by the same researcher, whose methods were flawed enough that her own university distanced itself from the survey he created.\\n\\nJennifer Freyd, the researcher, is back with a study little changed since 2014, purporting to find the same number of women as victims. To be clear, the women who took the study aren\\'t necessarily claiming they were ever victims — Freyd and her researchers determined that they were victims based on questions answered. Freyd\\'s only acknowledgement that there might be a flaw to her methodology is that factors like \"poor memory\" might make the numbers lower than they should be — that is, many women might have forgotten they were assaulted.\\n\\nOf course, this study will be used as a model for other schools, meaning again and again the myth that one in five women will be sexually assaulted will continue. That myth will be used to continue to claim that due process rights are an impediment to justice, leaving young campus men vulnerable to witch hunts.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve written before, replicating a flawed study does not make it true.',\n",

Their lived experiences are immaterial and can be dismissed as merely anecdotal. Make it clear that you are not racist or sexist, you are merely concerned about their plight. What plight? Well, pick one. Or several. Marriage, children, lack of the above, too much education, not enough education, welfare, whatever you think will sell. It only matters that you highlight their troublesome natures. Whatever it is, you must be sure to make it clear that they aren’t like other women. They are failing to perform in some way that affects the whole of society, even if you can’t quite explain how or why their personal lives are public property. Further, rely heavily on the idea of research that shows the problem is a problem. Never mention exactly when that research was done, or who were the subjects of it. Too much context may unnecessarily complicate the conversation.\\n\\nUtilize stereotypes whenever possible, preferably ones that tie into the Mammy, Jezebel, or Sapphire tropes. Describe black women in ways that play up their sexuality and remove their humanity. After all they are Other, so their skin is a food stuff, the space between their thighs is mysterious, and they have never ever been innocent. No need to mention virginity or purity, even when speaking of black female infants, your focus must be on their sexuality. If you are speaking of black mothers make it clear that they need guidance, financial support, or salvation. What salvation? Well that all depends on whether they work too little and thus are on welfare, or work too much and thus are neglecting their children. There is no point at which they can balance work and family, because again they are Other and that is not possible for them. They are emasculating and thus unworthy of relationships, or the key to being masculine with their all knowing sexuality that is present from birth. Unrapeable, they can be trusted to raise any children but their own, and are sexually available until they become sexless.\\n\\nThey exist to be support systems, whether for men of all colors or women of every color but black. No need to mention their needs, hopes, dreams, or concerns. They have none, even if they do occasionally speak of themselves as real people with feelings. Their voices are too loud, too uneducated, or simply too aggressive. They are always angry about something, but their feelings aren’t real so they don’t matter. Be sure to specify how reasonable you are in the face of their unreasonable behavior. Write of how you studied them at a safe distance, while proclaiming that some of your closest friends are black women. No need to know anything about those close friends, but their names since all that matters is that you have them as proof that you know your subject, and are not racist or sexist.\\n\\nContrast them with women of other races, always making sure to highlight that other women are real women, while black women are simply black. Feel free to make blanket statements about their religious beliefs, educational levels, income levels, and family dynamics. All of it is true because you say it is, and you are the expert in black women, not any actual black women. If they are offended by your words, remind them of your credentials and refuse to engage in a conversation with them until they can be less emotional. Point to their tone as a reason to doubt the veracity of their experiences. After all they are only black women and thus they know nothing, own nothing, and are worth nothing but what you say they are.',\n",

IT ALL HAPPENED OUTSIDE PAPINEAU PAT\\'S GUN STORE ON WOODLAND BOULEVARD. ERIC SANDOVAL IS THERE THIS EVENING. DID THEY ACTUALLY HIRE HIM TO GUARD THE PLACE? NO, THEY DIDN\\'T HIRE WITH ZIMMERMAN ACTUALLY. THE OWNER DIDN\\'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL POLICE TALKED TO HIM. THIS IS THE SAME PLACE THAT OFFERED HIM A FREE GUN AFTER BEING ACQUITTED OF KILLING TRAYVON MARTIN LAST YEAR. NOW ZIMMERMAN IS TRYING TO HELP THE OWNER WITH SOMEONE BREAKING IN. POLICE NOTICED THE CAR OUTSIDE THE GUN STORE. HE TOLD POLICE HE WAS WATCHING THE PLACE AFTER A RECENT BURGLARY. DID PAT HIRE YOU TO WATCH THIS? YOU\\'RE JUST DOING IT AS A FRIEND? HE\\'S A FRIEND OF MINE. OKAY. OKAY. THE TWO De LAND OFFICERS CALLED AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR OWNER, PAT JOHNSON, TO MAKE SURE HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. ZIMMERMAN TRIED TO EXPLAIN HE KNEW THE OWNER. AFTER ALL, JOHNSON OFFERED HIM A FREE GUN AFTER HIS MURDER TRIAL LAST YEAR. I\\'M JUST SAYING IT\\'S ALL OVER THE PAPERS, HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ME. I HAD NO IDEA. I HAD NO IDEA. REALLY? IT\\'S A SHAME. ZIMMERMAN GAVE THE OFFICERS HIS NAME AND ADDRESS IN THE POLICE REPORT. AN ADDRESS THAT LEADS TO A MAILBOX AT THE U.P.S. STORE IN SANFORD. DID YOU SEE WHAT I SAID? I DON\\'T SEE ANY GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HERE. CONVINCED THERE\\'S NOTHING BAD HAPPENING, THE OFFICERS LET HIM STAY AT THE GUN STORE, PATROLLING FOR BURGLARS. BACK OUT HERE LIVE, THE OFFICERS TALKED WITH ZIMMERMAN FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE A LITTLE STARSTRUCK FOR A FEW MOMENTS. THEY LET ZIMMERMAN GET OUT OF HIS TRUCK AND ACTUALLY SHOW THEM PRINTS OF HIS AMERICAN FLAG PAINTING, OF COURSE THAT WE REPORTED ON LATE LAST YEAR. I DO REMEMBER THAT, ERIC. SO WAS THERE ANYTHING TECHNICALLY CRIMINAL ABOUT WHAT ZIMMERMAN WAS DOING AT THAT STORE? THERE WAS NOTHING TECHNICALLY CRIMINAL ABOUT WHAT ZIMMERMAN WAS DOING AT THE GUN STORE. IT WAS MORE OF A QUESTION WHETHER THE OWNER ACTUALLY WANTED HIM HERE. WE SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE STORE OWNER, AND YOU\\'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT AT 6:00.

When a woman does it, no one cares. In fact, she’s just doing what she’s meant to. In actual fact, it’s nice of everyone to let her do it and to be honest isn’t she slightly taking the piss by having time off work, and she’d better not embarrass everyone by showing a bit of nipple. But let a dad so much as pick up a bottle, and watch the world swoon while angel choirs descend to sing oh isn’t he great and isn’t mum lucky that he babysits. Pass the wetwipes, I seem to have been sick.\\n\\nLow expectations. That’s what I’m talking about. That’s the great bonus of masculinity. But even I was taken aback to see a man getting praised for, um, fancying his wife. Robbie Tripp describes himself as a “wordsmith, public speaker, and creative activist” and the author of “an abstract manifesto for disruptive creativity”, which to be honest sound like the kind of things you’d make up to get worried relatives off your back. (“No grandma, I’m not unemployed, I’m a creative activist.”) He can now add to that CV the impressive achievement of being keen on the woman he married.\\n\\nYeah, I said impressive. It must be, because otherwise why would his saccharine ode to his wife Sarah Tripp’s “beautiful stretch marks on her hips and cute little dimples on her booty” have pulled in likes on Facebook and Instagram by the thousand, and ended up reported by Buzzfeed, the Mail, E! Online and every other content-thirsty outlet on the internet.\\n\\nNot that Tripp always felt able to be as open about his love. “As a teenager,” he writes, “I was often teased by my friends for my attraction to girls on the thicker side, ones who were shorter and curvier, girls that the average (basic) bro might refer to as chubby or even fat.” I can only assume that this is the kind of silver-tongued chat that Sarah Tripp finds irresistible, but as a quick FYI to any dudes looking to play the charmer, DON’T DO THIS. If your compliment game starts with “some men would call you fatty but I’m much smarter than them”, then what you’ve actually got is an insult game and can I suggest you kindly shove it.\\n\\nBut luckily, young Tripp found feminism and learned that he could objectify any woman he wanted! Um, feminism? Yes: “Then, as I became a man and started to educate myself on issues such as feminism and how the media marginalizes women by portraying a very narrow and very specific standard of beauty (thin, tall, lean) I realized how many men have bought into that lie.” Andrea Dworkin, if only you had lived to see this day and know you had liberated a man to share his love of “thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll.”\\n\\nLook. I’m happy Robbie Tripp is happy. I’m happy he’s making Sarah Tripp happy. But can we please, please get over this idea that a man is a hero for talking about what body type gives him a boner? And can we not treat him like some kind of body positivity pioneer for liking his objectively hot wife? (Contrary to his claim that “Her shape and size won't be the one featured on the cover of Cosmopolitan”, Cosmo has featured plus-size models.)

At this rate, the only thing women will be able to figure out are blankets. No, wait. Shit.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how the Snuggie happened. Was there some kind of need for a filthy robe you store on the floor? Was the Snuggie a scheme by the barbarian community to make wizards look less fuckable? All I know is that when you\\'re selling products to a demographic that has trouble with blankets, maybe it\\'s genetically irresponsible to sell anything other than poison labelled as candy.\\n\\nWhen they were developing the easier blanket, I can\\'t imagine who they talked to for market research. If you asked a focus group what\\'s hard about a blanket, they\\'d tell you, \"We\\'re happy our learning disabilities are finally coming in handy, but we don\\'t get how a person can fuck this up.\" Yet somehow, the Snuggie marketers decided that a fussy lady cursing the impossibility of blankets was the kind of situation late night TV viewers could relate to. The success of the product suggests that they were right, but their follow-up product, Snuggie for Dogs, suggests that they might just hear whispering voices that demand the Harbinger\\'s message be delivered in sleeves.',\n",

       " 'ESPN legal analyst Lester Munson reacts to former NFL star Darren Sharper being sentenced to 18 years in prison and what to expect since he still faces charges in other states for similar crimes. (1:30)\\n\\nNEW ORLEANS -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in a case in which he was accused of drugging and raping as many as 16 women in four states.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo sentenced Sharper on Thursday, telling him she couldn\\'t understand how he did what he did, as he was college educated and obviously had grown up \"in one of the most loving households.\"\\n\\n\"We can never ignore the damage you inflicted on those women and society at large,\" she said.\\n\\nSharper, jailed since February 2014, had pleaded guilty in federal court in New Orleans to drugging three women so he could rape them. He also has pleaded guilty or no contest in state courts in Louisiana, Arizona, California and Nevada to charges arising from allegations of drugging and raping women.\\n\\n\"I would like to apologize a thousand times,\" Sharper said. He looked at the floor as he said, \"I\\'m still trying to figure out why I made some of these choices. ... I lived my life right for 38 years, then I took this path.\"\\n\\nHis voice thickened and broke as he said his parents hadn\\'t raised him to take such actions.\\n\\nDarren Sharper was given an 18-year prison sentence -- 15 months short of the maximum -- and was also fined $20,000 for drugging and raping women in multiple states. AP Photo/Los Angeles Times/Bob Chamberlin\\n\\nDefense attorney Billy Gibbens asked for leniency because Sharper\\'s testimony helped get \"late\" guilty pleas from two co-defendants who will be sentenced in October.\\n\\nSharper will be sentenced on Aug. 25 in Louisiana state court, Gibbens said outside court. He said he believes Sharper will be sentenced next month in Las Vegas and couldn\\'t recall the Los Angeles sentencing date.\\n\\nAn Arizona judge sentenced him to nine years and what both Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael McMahon and Gibbens said amounted to lifetime probation.\\n\\nMcMahon told the judge in court, \"I don\\'t think Mr. Sharper has really wrapped his head around the fact that he is a serial rapist.\"\\n\\nA woman who woke up next to Sharper after being drugged also spoke before Milazzo handed down the sentence. The woman\\'s voice was shaky and she frequently brought a handkerchief to her eyes. Her name was not given in court, and The Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse by name.\\n\\nShe told Sharper that because of arrogance and \"clear stupidity,\" he kept drugging and raping women even after he knew she was talking to state and federal investigators.\\n\\n\"Within days ... you gave me ... and the entire judicial system in Louisiana the big middle finger because you thought we weren\\'t capable of stopping you,\" she said. \"You continued to rape other women in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas.\"\\n\\nShe said she understands that people make mistakes. \"But it wasn\\'t a mistake. A mistake happens once and you never make it again.\" Rather, she said, it was \"a way of life for you and your friends.\"\\n\\nProsecutors suggested a 9-year prison term for Sharper under a multi-jurisdictional plea deal, but Milazzo rejected it in June as too lenient. The sentence she imposed, 18 years and four months imprisonment, was 15 months short of the maximum. Sharper also was fined $20,000.\\n\\nSharper is getting the same sentence on each of three counts of distributing drugs with rape as the aim, but they will run concurrently with each other and with state sentences, the judge said. She said he will be on three years\\' supervised release after he gets out of prison, including \"sex treatment conditions\" and registration as a sex offender.\\n\\nSharper\\'s family left the courtroom without speaking to reporters. Gibbens said later that the federal sentence won\\'t affect plea agreements in the four state courts.\\n\\nSharper or his friend Brandon Licciardi, a former sheriff\\'s deputy in neighboring St. Bernard Parish, put anti-anxiety drugs or sedatives into women\\'s drinks so they could rape them, according to a 15-page statement signed as part of Sharper\\'s plea agreement.\\n\\nMilazzo has scheduled sentencing Oct. 13 for Licciardi and a second New Orleans codefendant, Erik Nunez.\\n\\nOutside the courtroom, McMahon quietly asked the woman, \"Are you ready to do this in October?\" She nodded.\\n\\nCharges around the country involve nine victims, but Milazzo has said in court that there could be as many as 16.\\n\\nShe said Thursday that she will, as Gibbens requested, recommend a prison either in Petersburg, Virginia, or Butner, North Carolina, so he can be near his family in Richmond, Virginia\\n\\nLike Sharper, Licciardi and Nunez admitted distributing drugs with the intent to commit rape. Their federal plea agreements say Licciardi has accepted a 17-year sentence, with 10 years for Nunez.\\n\\nSharper was named All-Pro six times and chosen for the Pro Bowl five times during a career that included stints with the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings. He played in two Super Bowls, one with the Packers as a rookie and one with New Orleans Saints when they won in 2010.\\n\\nHe ended a 14-year career in 2011.

Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a pinata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish. Michael Lewis\\'s investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners.

       " 'A Muslim student at a liberal arts college in Wisconsin has been arrested for spray painting reprehensible anti-Muslim messages on his own dorm room door and then filing a report claiming that he was the victim of a hate crime.\\n\\nThe totally fake hate crime occurred last weekend at Beloit College, a 1,400-student bastion bursting with idiosyncratic individualists who enjoy leftist politics.\\n\\nThe student who falsely claimed that he was a victim of a terrible hate crime is Michael Kee, campus police told regional Fox affiliate WQRF-TV.\\n\\nThere were three spray-painted messages — all in bold red. In addition to “Sand nigger go home,” the other two messages read “#muslimban” and “Die,” according to a contemporaneous account by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\\n\\nThere was also a red swastika spray-painted on a wall across from Kee’s room on the third floor of Bushnell Hall, an ugly slab of concrete on the Beloit campus.\\n\\nThe Journal Sentinel identifies Kee as Muslim.\\n\\nA campus security officer found the messages on Kee’s dorm room door at around 2:30 a.m. on Monday morning.\\n\\nThe discovery came three days after Beloit campus police had opened a separate investigation into an anti-Semitic note that another student found slipped under a dorm room door.\\n\\n“Kike, You should be gassed for what you say & do on this campus. Be worried cunt,” the anti-Semitic note read, according to The Times of Israel.\\n\\nInvestigators say Kee, 20, eventually admitted that he perpetrated the hoax because he hoped to receive the same kind of attention received by the student who allegedly received the anti-Semitic note.\\n\\n“There were certain indicators that led us to believe there was a little more to the story,” Beloit police chief David Zibolski told WQRF-TV.\\n\\n“We were already investigating the first incident when this one came up, which obviously ratcheted up the fear and concern on campus,” Zibolski said.\\n\\nHere is Kee:\\n\\nBeloit campus police say they believe the anti-Semitic note slipped under the dorm door is a legitimate hate crime. They have named no suspects. They say they continue to investigate.\\n\\nPrior to the police revelation that Kee himself scrawled the anti-Muslim messages on his own dorm room door as well as the swastika across the hall, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel suggested that Kee’s hoax hate crime was part of “chaos” building “around the country over President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.”\\n\\nBeloit police responded to the anti-Semitic note and Kee’s spray-painting hoax by ramping up campus patrols and adding residence hall entry limitations.\\n\\nBeloit College president Scott Bierman sent a campus-wide email lamenting the “horrifying hate-filled threat” police now say Kee perpetrated on himself.\\n\\n“I am, we are, overcome with concern for the well-being of our students and filled with anger and outrage because someone in our community feels emboldened to attack them,” Bierman pontificated, according to the Journal Sentinel.\\n\\n“Let us reject hate together.”\\n\\nAfter the hoax was exposed, Beloit College released a statement indicating that the school vows to crack down on hate crimes.\\n\\n“This situation does not diminish the college’s resolve in resisting xenophobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and Islamophobia that aims to intimidate and silence its targets,” reads the statement obtained by Madison, Wisconsin NBC affiliate WMTV.\\n\\nThe Beloit campus police department issued a similar statement.\\n\\n“Kee’s incident does not diminish our resolve going forward with these reported incidents and any other reported crimes of this nature,” the campus police said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kee faces a trio of charges: criminal damage to property, disorderly conduct and obstruction.\\n\\nThe cost for a single year of tuition, fees and room and board at Beloit is $55,206, according to the school’s website.\\n\\nThe school is located in a pleasant Wisconsin town, just over the Illinois border.\\n\\nThe hoax at Beloit adds a fresh chapter to the ever-growing throng of alleged hate crimes that turned out to be hoaxes. (RELATED: 2016: The Year Of The Hoax Hate Crime)\\n\\nSome hoaxes of recent vintage have involved threats or attacks — which totally did not happen — against Muslims.\\n\\nIn December, a Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention after claiming a drunk twentysomething man threatened to light her on fire and forced her to remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax. (RELATED: Anti-Muslim Threat At University Of Michigan Was A Huge Hoax)\\n\\nAlso in December, an 18-year-old Muslim woman named Yasmin Seweid was the subject of breathless headlines after she claimed to have been attacked by a group of Donald Trump supporters on a New York subway while onlookers did nothing. She, too, would go on to confess that she made the whole thing up. (RELATED: Muslim Woman Reportedly Admits To Fabricating NYC Subway Attack)\\n\\nIn November, another 18-year-old Muslim woman, this one in Louisiana, claimed two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted that she made the whole thing up. (RELATED: Here Are All The Hate Crime Hoaxes That Have Plagued The Country Since Trump’s Election)\\n\\nLast this month, a hate crime narrative pushed by several media outlets vanished into thin air when police arrested a twentysomething man with previous domestic violence convictions for the brutal, senseless murder of Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a University of Wisconsin–Stout student from Saudi Arabia. A complete lack of evidence of any hate crime did not stop local police investigators and The Washington Post from raising the possibility of a hate crime. “Many” unidentified “advocates” who are concerned about hate crimes “point to rhetoric from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has at various points called for a complete ban on Muslim immigrants,” the Post proclaimed in a November story just after the murder.

King, District Judge, Presiding.\\nBefore HUG, T.G. NELSON and GOULD, Circuit Judges.\\nOPINION\\nGOULD, Circuit Judge.\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n1\\nDefendants-Appellants City of Beaverton and Washington County, Oregon appeal the district court\\'s entry of a permanent injunction preventing them from enforcing their trash-hauling regulations against plaintiff-appellee AGG Enterprises (\"AGG\"). AGG collects and disposes of loads of construction materials-mixed solid waste containing part recyclables and part non-recyclables — from its nonresidential customers. Defendants consider mixed solid waste the same as regular garbage or refuse, and they want AGG to be subject to their trash-hauling regulations.\\n\\n\\n2\\nAGG sued defendants for injunctive relief from those regulations in the district court, claiming that local trash-hauling regulations were preempted by a provision in the Federal Aviation Administration Authorizing Act of 1994 (\"FAAAA\"), 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c), that preempted state regulation of motor carriers transporting property. The district court granted a permanent injunction.\\n\\n\\n3\\nDefendants claim that the district court erred because Congress did not intend for mixed solid waste to be considered \"property,\" and therefore the local regulations are not preempted. We agree, reverse the district court, and vacate the permanent injunction.\\n\\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\\n\\n4\\nPlaintiff-appellee AGG Enterprises, Inc. (\"AGG\") is a waste removal service with operations in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. AGG contracts with customers at commercial, industrial, and construction sites to collect materials such as brick, glass, tile, concrete, wood, cardboard, plastic, and metal. AGG\\'s intra-Oregon services are at issue.\\n\\n\\n5\\nAGG handles two types of trash loads: recyclables presorted by customers (\"source sorted\"), and unsorted loads of non-recyclable, dry garbage mixed with recyclables (\"mixed solid waste\" or \"MSW\"). Only the MSW loads are at issue.\\n\\n\\n6\\nAfter AGG picks up the MSW loads from its customers, it delivers the loads to East County Recycling (\"ECR\"), a material recovery facility. ECR separates recyclables, recycles them, and hauls non-recyclables to a landfill. Neither AGG nor any AGG customer receives a rebate for the recyclable portion of a mixed solid waste load. According to AGG, customers with high labor costs find it cost-effective to have AGG pick up their mixed solid waste loads rather than to sort the recyclables themselves. AGG claims that the government-licensed trash haulers available to these customers will not take MSW to a recycling center such as ECR. AGG suggests that these customers rely on AGG to meet recycling commitments.\\n\\n\\n7\\nAGG does not know exactly how much of a customer\\'s load is recyclable. AGG brings almost all its loads to ECR. ECR collects 60,000 tons of MSW per year, and claims that it recycles 50% to 60% of that. The owner of ECR stated that \"he played with the numbers\" one time to try to take into account the concrete and asphalt recycling from the MSW, and that brought the recycling rate up to 80% to 90%. Under the most extreme view, on average at least 10% to 20% of each load is garbage that is not recyclable.\\n\\n\\n8\\nDefendants-appellants Washington County and City of Beaverton (\"Beaverton\") regulate trash collection through the use of exclusive franchises. Both issue licenses or certificates granting exclusive authority to collect waste in one of 35 geographical areas. Under both systems, the exclusive franchisee provides residential and commercial collection. Neither defendant regulates source sorted recyclables. Businesses and persons may haul waste they generate, without a license or certificate.\\n\\n\\n9\\nAGG does not hold an exclusive license. As a result, Beaverton cited AGG for unauthorized collection of solid waste, a violation with a maximum fine of $250. AGG then applied for a license from the City of Beaverton. After Beaverton informed AGG it would not take further action on AGG\\'s licensing application, AGG brought suit for injunctive relief in the district court.1\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe district court found that plaintiff was a \"motor carrier\" transporting \"property\" and that the Federal Aviation administration Authorizing Act of 1994 (\"FAAAA\") preempted the defendants\\' exclusive licensing schemes. The district court granted plaintiff the permanent injunction, and defendants and intervenors appealed.2\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nI. Standard of Review\\n\\n11\\nWe review de novo the district court\\'s decision regarding preemption. See Nathan Kimmel, Inc. v. DowElanco, 275 F.3d 1199, 1203 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo the district court\\'s interpretation and construction of the FAAAA. See Rowe v. Laidlaw Transit, Inc., 244 F.3d 1115, 1117 (9th Cir.2001).\\n\\nII. Language of the Statute\\n\\n12\\nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, federal law is the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" U.S. Const. art. VI. Federal law overrides any conflicting state or local law. See Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission, 461 U.S. 190, 204, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983). Federal preemption \"may be either express or implied, and `is compelled whether Congress\\' command is explicitly stated in the statute\\'s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.\\'\" Branco v. UFCW Northern-California Employers Joint Pension Plan, No. 00-15884, 2002 WL 200910, at *2 (9th Cir. Feb.11, 2002) (quoting Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977)). We must decide whether the FAAAA preempts local entities from regulating the collection of MSW loads.\\n\\n\\n13\\nPreemption analysis begins with the \"presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.\" New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 654, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995). Also, \"in cases ... where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" Id. at 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671 (internal citations omitted). Although Congress clearly intended the FAAAA to preempt some state regulations, we consider this \"presumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations\" when we analyze the scope of the preemption. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996).\\n\\n\\n14\\nCongress has recognized that waste hauling is a traditional state and local function subject to state regulation. See 42 U.S.C. § 6901(a)(4) (stating that \"the collection and disposal of solid waste should continue to be primarily the function of State, Regional and local agencies\"). Our precedent has recognized the strong local governmental interest in regulating garbage collection. Kleenwell Biohazard Waste and General Ecology Consultants, Inc. v. Nelson, 48 F.3d 391, 398 (9th Cir.1995). One could hardly imagine an area of regulation that has been considered to be more intrinsically local in nature than collection of garbage and refuse, upon which may rest the health, safety, and aesthetic well-being of the community. See generally California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works of San Francisco, 199 U.S. 306, 318, 26 S.Ct. 100, 50 L.Ed. 204 (1905); Kleenwell, 48 F.3d at 398. The historic responsibility of local governments to ensure safe and comprehensive garbage collection posts a strong caution against the possibility that Congress lightly would preempt local regulation in this field.\\n\\n\\n15\\nOur inquiry under Blue Cross, and in light of this cautionary history, is whether it was the \"clear and manifest\" intention of Congress to preempt local regulation of the collection of loads containing part recyclable materials and part non-recyclables. 514 U.S. at 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671.\\n\\n\\n16\\nWe previously have held that the FAAAA\\'s preemption of regulation of the collection of mixed solid waste is not \"readily apparent.\" See Woodfeathers, Inc. v. Washington County, Oregon, 180 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.1999). Woodfeathers was a case about Younger abstention, and when we held that preemption was not \"readily apparent,\" we were deciding only that FAAAA preemption of MSW regulation was an unsettled issue. See id. at 1021-22. We pick up now where we left off in Woodfeathers to decide the issue we there stated was undecided.\\n\\n\\n17\\nTo determine Congress\\' intent on preemption, we begin with the \"text of the provision in question, and move on, as need be, to the structure and purpose of the Act in which it occurs.\" Blue Cross, 514 U.S. at 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671. Section 601(c) of the FAAAA provides:\\n\\n\\n18\\n(c) Motor carriers of property. —\\n\\n\\n19\\n(1) General Rule. — Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder with respect to the transportation of property.\\n\\n\\n20\\n49 U.S.C. § 14501(c). \"Property\" is the operative word for Our analysis, but Congress did not define the term. Nor is the meaning of \"property\" perfectly clear from the context of the statute. So, to interpret this statute in accord with Congress\\' intent, it is appropriate that we look beyond the text of the statute to determine Congress\\' purpose in enacting this statute.\\n\\nIII. Legislative History\\n\\n21\\nLegislative history shows that the major purpose of the FAAAA preemption clause was to \"level the playing field between air carriers on the one hand and motor carriers on the other with respect to intrastate economic trucking regulation....\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677, at 82 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1715, 1754. Congress was concerned that package delivery companies organized as \"motor carriers,\" such as UPS, were subject to state regulation, whereas companies organized as \"air carriers,\" such as Federal Express, were free from state regulation. See id. Although this shows Congress had an intent different than preempting state regulation of solid waste collection, it does not settle the issue, because Congress may have had more than one purpose.\\n\\n\\n22\\nOther legislative history gives insight into the intent of Congress on the scope of preemption and regulation of solid waste collection:\\n\\n\\n23\\nThe conferees further clarify that the motor carrier preemption provision does not preempt State regulation of garbage and refuse collectors. The managers have been informed by the Department of Transportation that under ICC case law, garbage and refuse are not considered `property.\\' Thus garbage collectors are not considered `motor carriers of property\\' and are thus unaffected by this provision.\\n\\n\\n24\\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677, at 85 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1715, 1757. We said in dicta in Woodfeathers that the force of this piece of legislative history was debatable because the Interstate Commerce Commission (\"ICC\") case law, which Congress was told did not consider garbage and refuse \"property,\" is equivocal as to whether it could be \"property\" or not. 180 F.3d at 1022. However, it is irrelevant in our present analysis whether or not ICC case law is equivocal. We are not concerned with what ICC case law says, but with what Congress intended in its statute and at most with what Congress thought ICC case law said. That is what shows us whether Congress had a \"clear and manifest\" intent to preempt state regulation of the collection of MSW loads. This legislative history is important, because it shows that if Congress exhibited any clear intent, it was an intent not to preempt state and local regulation of solid waste collectors. Even if Congress was misinformed as to what ICC case law held, it believed that the statute it was passing would not affect local regulation of garbage and refuse collection.\\n\\n\\n25\\nAGG offers no other contrary legislative history to show an intent by Congress to preempt local waste collection laws.3 Instead, AGG claims that the legislative history does not hurt its case. AGG argues that ICC case law considers MSW loads \"property,\" and that therefore MSW is not \"garbage and refuse,\" and is unaffected by the legislative history.\\n\\n\\n26\\nWe decline AGG\\'s invitation delicately to parse the holdings of several ICC cases in combination. As stated above, we need not scrutinize ICC case law. About 40% to 50% of the MSW loads taken by AGG is non-recyclable garbage and must be taken to a landfill. Even under the highest proposed recycle rate, when the recycling center \"played with the numbers,\" an average of 10% to 20% of the MSW load was non-recyclable. So it is undebatable that at least ten to twenty percent of everything AGG collects, thousands of tons, is \"garbage and refuse.\" This is a lot of garbage, and we cannot accept the argument that Congress precluded local government entities from regulating its collection. Absent a \"clear and manifest\" purpose, if not an explicit instruction, from Congress, we decline to divest states and local governments of this area of regulation, crucial to health and safety. To the contrary, Congress\\' intent not to preempt the area of solid waste collection is unambiguous.\\n\\n\\n27\\nOur decision is consistent with a persuasive decision of the California Court of Appeal that parallels this case. See Pleasant Hill Bayshore Disposal, Inc. v. Chip-It Recycling, Inc., 91 Cal.App.4th 678, 110 Cal.Rptr.2d 708, 714 (2001). That court ruled that the FAAAA does not preempt local regulation of the collection of MSW loads. We agree with that court that \"[i]t verges on the inconceivable that Congress had such an intent. There is nothing in the language or legislative history of [§ 601(c) of the FAAAA] giving the least credence to [the MSW hauler\\'s] claim that Congress intended to make itself the sole authority in a field where local authority has been traditionally accepted as preeminent.\" Id. at 717.\\n\\n\\n28\\nWe conclude that Congress did not show a \"clear and manifest\" intent to end state and local regulation of garbage and refuse collection merely because the load includes some recyclable material. That the load includes a significant amount of garbage is sufficient to permit local regulation.4\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n29\\nWe hold that the FAAAA does not preempt local regulation of the collection of mixed solid waste. We reverse the district court\\'s decision, vacate the permanent injunction, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n30\\nREVERSED, VACATED, and REMANDED.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n\\n1\\n Several hauling companies with exclusive licenses from Beaverton and Washington County intervened on the side of the defendants\\n\\n\\n2\\n The United States of America intervened as of right on appeal to defend the FAAAA against a claim by defendants that the FAAAA, if preemptive of trash-hauling regulation, violates the Commerce Clause. We do not reach that issue in view of our conclusion below that the FAAAA did not preempt the power of local jurisdictions to regulate garbage collection\\n\\n\\n3\\n AGG presents a few comments from members of Congress on a failed technical corrections billSee, e.g., 140 Cong. Rec. E1830-02 (daily ed. Sept. 12, 1994) (statement of Rep. Cantwell). The comments declare that curbside recycling should be considered the same as garbage and refuse, in that the FAAAA should have no preemptive effect on such regulation. AGG tries to parlay these comments to show that while curbside recycling was meant to be the same as garbage and refuse, MSW should be considered \"property.\" We do not subscribe to AGG\\'s interpretation for whatever weight these post-enactment comments might be worth.\\n\\n\\n4\\n We express no opinion whether Congress intended to preempt regulation of source separated recyclables\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Different host, same deranged hatred for all things Trump . . .\\n\\nOn MSNBC on Monday afternoon, Chris Jansing sat in for Nicolle Wallace on Deadline: White House. As our Bill D\\'Agostino has documented, Wallace has a history of unhinged Trump hatred. Things got so bad last week that Wallace was forced to apologize for accusing President Trump of \"talking about exterminating Latinos.\"\\n\\nOn Monday\\'s show, the question was whether it would be good political strategy, given President Trump\\'s alleged racism, to accuse the Trump base of being racists for supporting him. They turned to Frank Figliuzzi, an Obama-era FBI official and NBC National Security Analyst.\\n\\nCHRIS JANSING: I think one of the things, Frank Figliuzzi, is that this president has always, from anyone who was around him, Anthony Scaramucci knows this as well as anybody else, demanded this blind loyalty, right? \"I say it, it must be so. Or even if you don’t think it’s so, you don’t criticize me for it.\" FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Well, this is why it\\'s so important to look through the lens of radicalization when you look at this president and then apply counterradicalization techniques. Because you\\'re right, attacking his followers is going to be counterproductive. He demands that loyalty, and they are loyal. So if you call Trump followers racist en masse, they simply coalesce around each other and become more defensive and protective of the leader, just as they would in, say, a terrorist organization.\"\\n\\nUh, Frank: if calling Trump supporters racists will backfire, what would be the result if you liken them to members of a terrorist organization?!\\n\\nIt looks like Figliuzzi, to curry favor with MSNBC, is willing to abase himself with absurd anti-Trump allegations. Last week, as our Gregory Price noted, Figliuzzi made a fool of himself, claiming that President Trump, by ordering flags flown at half-staff to honor mass-shooting victims until August 8th, i.e., 8-8, was sending a secret coded message to neo-Nazis.\\n\\nEarlier in the segment, Figluzzi bizarrely claimed that in Trump\\'s statement after the El Paso and Dayton shootings, \"We didn\\'t see him personally renounce the violence, personally say I\\'m not about white hate.\"\\n\\nBut a transcript shows he renounced the violence: \"These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror.\"\\n\\nAnd he renounced the racist hate: \"The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul.\"',\n",

So the fact this guy is at the gym, flexing in the middle, knowing he looks like what he looks like, and taking selfies in the middle of the gym for all to see, I mean, come on. If he didn’t want people to see him, he would flex for selfies from the comfort of his own home. He wants people to see him. And if he’s so proud of his development, then he wouldn’t care people are looking at him.\\n\\nI’m not dense enough to say I don’t see the other side of it. Nobody wants to be mocked or ridiculed or any of that. And the point of the video clearly isn’t that he’s at the gym trying to better himself, because that’s awesome. It’s the action of him flexing which is funny. Funny is funny is funny. And it’s not like the video was stolen or he was hacked or anything, he was doing that in a public place. Now, we can talk about the merits of filming someone in public and if that person is a loser too (they are 1000% a loser), but that’s a whole different can of worms that I don’t want to go down.\\n\\nI guess the moral in 2018 is, anything you do in front of a room full of people is free game.

Sanchez is a good player who improves our forward line, but it really doesn\\'t look like it\\'s more than the sum of its parts, it\\'s just three (or four) individual players doing their thing.\\n\\nWe were banging in the goals in the first month of the season, but our scoring rate has been gradually dribbling downward since then. In fact, after the first six games, which we did really well in, our record for the past 20 games is exactly the same as Liverpool\\'s.\\n\\n\"Despite his reputation, United manager\\'s faith in youth has put Guardiola in the shade\"\\n\\nIt was mostly overlooked at the time, a casualty of the fanfare surrounding Alexis Sanchez\\'s signing a few days earlier, but when Manchester United announced Jose Mourinho had signed a new contract last month, there was a line from the club\\'s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, praising the manager\\'s commitment to blooding youth.\"He has embraced the club\\'s desire to promote top quality young players to the first team,\" said Woodward, a pointed response to those who suggested the Portuguese would pay little more than lip service to the club\\'s rich traditions of cultivating home-grown talent.Those suggestions had solid enough foundations. For all the success Mourinho\\'s managerial career has brought him, there has been a perennial black splodge next to the box marked youth development and no one has been more aware of this than the man himself.It has felt very different at United, though, and while entrenched reputations can take a long time to change, certain perceptions are, for now at least, being challenged.There has been an understandable rush to measure Mourinho and United\\'s every move against what Pep Guardiola has been doing at Manchester City. But while Guardiola has raised all sorts of bars this term, there is a certain irony that Mourinho - \"the monster that kills the little kids\" as he sarcastically described himself last week - has bought into the academy ethos in a way his great adversary, often heralded as a champion of youth, has yet to do with any particular conviction down the road.Tomorrow marks the 60th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, and on a weekend when United supporters honoured the memory of the Busby Babes - one of the ultimate symbols of the potency of youth - there was something rather poignant about Mourinho dropping Paul Pogba and playing academy graduate Scott McTominay in the £89million man\\'s place against Huddersfield.Before anyone hints at an ulterior motive there, it is worth remembering that Mourinho has never been one for sentiment and that McTominay had already made more starts this season than the entirety of the five academy graduates at City who have fleetingly tasted first-team football under Guardiola since August. Note, too, that Marcus Rashford has made more appearances - 90 - than anyone since Mourinho took charge at United and another academy graduate, Jesse Lingard, who has also flourished, is fourth on that list.While Mourinho was extolling the virtues of McTominay, or the \"kid\" as he affectionately calls him, Guardiola was whining about not having enough players in the wake of a mounting injury list and a failed move for Riyad Mahrez, and reiterated the point with a grimly petty decision to name only six substitutes against Burnley.Such arguments really do not hold much sway when you have spent £450 million in 19 months and have an academy awash with exciting talents, any number of whom would have benefited from the experience of a match-day with the first-team squad. \"If you\\'re the academy or reserve-team manager at Manchester City, you must think, \\'I\\'m wasting my time\\',\" said Gary Neville, the former United defender and Sky Sports pundit. \"Rather than saying in an interview, \\'I haven\\'t got the players\\', he could say he\\'s brought a young player from the youth team who has been wonderful this season. It\\'s really poor. And I can guarantee you the youth-team coach and reserve-team coach at Manchester City will feel disheartened by him having six players on the bench.\"It was a wretched move Mourinho\\'s critics might have once expected him to make but the tide seems to be turning.',\n",

       " 'Mommie Fearest\\n\\nIf done poorly, films that attempt to softly contextualize the actions of murderers and sociopaths are more than just failures; they’re dangerous. They inadvertently feed into America’s occasional obsession with fetishizing homicide, perpetuating a culture in which real-life killers can almost always bank on achieving a measure of fame for their crimes. Writer/director Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin flat out embarrasses films like those, demonstrating that it’s possible to explore the humanity of a murderous situation without making a carnival out of it.\\n\\nThis is, in part, because Ramsay’s eye is trained not on the killer, but on his mother. Tilda Swinton plays Eva Khatchadourian, a woman for whom motherhood was a rotting albatross carcass hung around her neck. She loves her husband, Franklin (John C. Reilly), but her pregnancy was an unwelcomed accident that rendered her lifelong aspirations secondary. Which might not have been so bad, if her son wasn’t a vile, awful prick from birth.\\n\\nEven as an infant, Kevin seems to sense his mother’s disdain for the concept of his existence, as he wails and moans whenever he feels her presence. As a child, Kevin (Jasper Newell) moves from difficult to evil, playing mind games with his mother that involve self-defecation and baiting her into abuse. Finally, as a teenager, Kevin (Ezra Miller) succumbs to the inevitability of his true self and becomes a full-fledged murdering monster.\\n\\nBut even though his name may be in the title, this is not Kevin’s movie: It’s Eva’s. Told in a jumbled chronological order in which everything seems to be happening at once, which is how it must feel for a woman whose womb once housed a maniac, the film asks such terrible questions. Are some kids just born bad? How much do blame does a loveless mother deserve? Eva’s answer to the latter seems to be quite a bit, as she spends the bulk of the movie enduring the sometimes physical retribution paid by the families of her son’s victims and inflicting penance upon herself.\\n\\nSwinton’s performance is the kind that renders praise stupid. Opinions on the film overall may vary, but the greatness displayed by the lead actress transcends perspective and is simply fact. At times we resent Eva; her cold, selfish demeanor and contempt for her son’s very existence is repulsive. But in other moments, we simply pity her, for what could anyone do to curb the behavior of a human being seemingly built to destroy?\\n\\nRamsay is ultra-heavy-handed here, with blood red color strewn somewhere in nearly every scene. Points about nature versus nurture are driven home by jackhammer. Still, the exceptional, almost nightmarish composition of chronology blends with a truly unique set of characters to deliver a singular experience like few others out there. This is as much a horror movie as a drama, as much a thriller as a character sketch. In other words, you don’t just need to talk about We Need to Talk About Kevin; you need to see it.',\n",

       " 'Memoirs of a Butch Lesbian\\n\\nTag Archives: Teena Brandon\\n\\nLet’s talk about public bathrooms. And airport security. And dressing rooms. And all of the other places that lesbians who don’t conform to the patriarchy’s ideal of what a woman should look like go where we are incorrectly identified as not being women. Places where we are accosted, detained, assaulted, barred from entering, humiliated, mocked, abused, beaten, and even raped; all because we dare to thumb our noses at the binary and proudly remain the women that we are, the women we choose to be, regardless of what the patriarchy demands.\\n\\nYou can even include all of those places where we go for doctor’s appointments, job interviews, etc. Places where our name is called and when we respond, the person calling our name is confused and unable to reconcile the woman’s name on their form with the person in front of them because of how the patriarchy conditions all of us to view women.\\n\\nA lot of lesbians, dykes, and especially butches don’t fit that perception. We never have. We have always done woman in our own way without a care in the world about how society sees us, while refusing to change who we are when society tries to change us through shame and violence.\\n\\nWe all have the stories, you know the ones. I am walking towards the woman’s bathroom when an older woman walks out the door and then stands there, trying to keep me from entering while telling me this is the ladies restroom, as if I cannot read or see the small female figure in a skirt on the door. Or the times, so many times, I lost count of when I am finishing up in the woman’s restroom, washing my hands when a woman opens the door, looks at me, pauses, looks at the sign on the door, looks at me again, and then just stands there frozen. Or even those times when they don’t stand frozen, but feign confusion asking if this is the ladies room.\\n\\nWe butches, as well as non-conforming dykes and lesbians, we all have stories like these, with varying degrees of danger and humiliation. I have butch friends who flat out refuse to use the woman’s restroom unless a femme friend or lover accompanies them to keep the stares, and the violence, to a minimum. Other butch friends won’t go to the woman’s restroom, no matter what, because they have dealt with such humiliation and violence before that to even consider using a woman’s public bathroom gives them an anxiety attack.\\n\\nThere are other stories, of course: being denied entry into the woman’s dressing room at a clothing store, the stares and murmurs, and even some women moving to another area, while we are changing in a woman’s dressing room at the YMCA, having to go through airport security more than once or, worse, being detained because the people at security look at us and see: men.\\n\\nThese stories go on and on and on for all of us, so it really wasn’t a shock to see news reports online of a woman, Susan Ho, who was using the woman’s restroom at a casino where she was entered in a bowling tournament, only to be unlawfully detained and assaulted when she tried to exit the bathroom and was accused of being a man in the woman’s restroom. At one point, the people detaining her even went so far as to discuss the possibility of removing Susan’s shirt to see if she was actually a woman, as she said. Read the full article here: http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/10/08/61853.htm\\n\\nI say I am not shocked when I see this sort of thing in the news, but it doesn’t make reading about it any less disheartening. As I said before, some lesbians and dykes and especially we butches don’t fit the patriarchal view of what women “should” look like. When people see me in my jeans, t-shirt, and hat, they make a snap judgment and see what their conditioning tells them to see: a man.\\n\\nSee, we are the real gender non-conformists. I know that transgenders and their apologists and allies love to make the false claim that trans men and trans woman are gender non-conformists, but that is all smoke and mirrors to hide what is actually happening. Trans people are the very opposite of gender non-conformists. They do everything they possibly can to completely and utterly conform to the binary.\\n\\nLook at trans men. When on T, what is the first thing trans men do? Go out of their way to grow facial hair because, to them, facial hair is one of the biggest defining factors of maleness, of being men. Forget the fact that there are women out there who have no choice but to shave their faces because for one medical reason or another (this differs woman to woman), they have facial hair.\\n\\nThen look at trans women. They are one hundred percent about presentation; and that presentation is driven by male desire, by the patriarchy, by what they, as men, find attractive in women. They must dress and act in extremes with the long hair, tons of make up, and dresses all the time because when men think about women, this is how they see women in their minds’ eyes: as a completely vamped up, stylized version of woman.\\n\\nBoth trans men and trans women go out of their way to be as “manly” or as “womanly” (respectively) as they can be because that is what the patriarchy, what the binary demands. Pick one or the other, the patriarchy says. If you wear men’s clothing, you must be a man; and if you wear women’s clothing, you must be a woman. If you are going to be a man or a woman, make sure to be the most über man or woman you can be so that we are positive that that is what you are. It is this same line of thinking that has parents turning tomboys into little trans men and feminine boys into little trans women. In the parents’ eyes, they are doing their child a favor but what they are really doing is forcing their child into the binary box.\\n\\nButches, as well as non-conforming lesbians and dykes on the other hand, are who they are while still being women, the patriarchy be damned. Instead of conforming, we, literally, stand out and are the most visible women in the lesbian community. We take a lot of heat for that, yes, but we love our bodies, we love being women, and we are not going to “transition” into some variation of men simply to please the patriarchal binary system.\\n\\nTransgenderism is, at its very core, conformity. That is the number one goal of transgenderism: conforming to the binary. Butches and non-conforming dykes and lesbians want the very opposite.\\n\\nTransgenders try to co-opt our words by claiming to be women and even lesbians. They try to co-opt our spaces by forcing their way into women’s restrooms, dressing rooms, and other woman-only spaces. They try to control our bodies by shaming us into having sex with them or else be labeled bigots and transphobes. They even try to steal our histories by turning women like Teena Brandon into a trans man, by claiming the butch and drag queen who started the Stonewall riots were actually a trans man and trans woman, etc.\\n\\nThey do all of this under the guise that they are gender non-conformists, when the truth of the matter is simply this: if trans people were truly non-conformists, there would be no transgenderism. Women would be women and men would be men, regardless of how they dressed or acted; and there would be no back lash, no mocking or shaming, no violence toward them, towards all of us, for being who we are.\\n\\nNo, the true non-conformists are butches, lesbians, and dykes. A professor once told me in college, “You are a genderfuck.” He was right; and I am damn proud of it.\\n\\nIt’s a question I see all the time on-line these days. This is the age of queer and gender theory, when being a masculine woman simply isn’t good enough any longer and one must transition in order to be seen and heard. So tons of butches and young teenage lesbians transition into men, thinking the hate they have for their bodies, the invisibility they feel, and the anger they have towards a society that mocks them daily will disappear.\\n\\nSo, where have we gone?\\n\\nMost of us are kept silent, forced into the closet we already clawed our way out of because we are not allowed to talk about our lives. We are not allowed to openly discuss our love of our female bodies mixed with our masculine traits. We are not allowed to mention our mourning the loss of our butch sisters as they escape into the patriarchy we have spent our lives fighting against as it drags us, kicking and screaming into its binary system of thinking and being.\\n\\nTo do so means we are traitors to our own community, a community we helped to build and in 1969, a community for which we put ourselves out there and helped to start the Stonewall Riots. That’s another thing we are not allowed to talk about, by the way: Stonewall. The trans community has rewritten history so many times by taking away butches and replacing them with transmen that it is a wonder we even exist anymore.\\n\\nThe Stonewall riots were started by a butch and a drag queen, not a transman and a transwoman. Teena Brandon was a butch, not a transman. These are things we are not allowed to talk about without being called transphobes, without being threatened, without being bullied into silence by men (and the apologists who defend them) who cannot stand outspoken women.\\n\\nIt is not transphobic to celebrate the woman I am. It is not transphobic to not transition into a man in order to appease the patriarchy who demands that women are feminine and men are masculine. it is not transphobic to keep history true instead of allowing it to be changed by those who wish to use it to further their own agendas. It is not transphobic to speak my truths.\\n\\nSo instead of continuing to stay silent, I decided to create my own space where I can speak my truths and talk about my life as a butch woman, as a lesbian. I do not lead a glamorous life, I just lead my life and I wish to remain visible in this world of increasing butch invisibility so that other young women who are perhaps butch don’t get trapped in the false belief that if they are masculine, then they MUST be a man.',\n",

       " 'Why I’ve Given Up Shopping at American Apparel\\n\\nFirst published in The Huffington Post 30th April 2013\\n\\nShiny disco pants are everywhere and I need block-colour basics as much as the next girl, but cracks are beginning to show in American Apparel’s conscious-consumer chic.1. It’s stupidly expensive. The prices are not exactly student-friendly and I’m not sure I would be willing to pay £46 for a plain polyester sweatshirt (suspiciously similar to the type I was forced to wear at school) even if I had a real income.2. The ‘fitness’ clothes are completely impractical. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried the gym in a mesh bodysuit with a thong bottom, but I wouldn’t advise it. Also, all bodysuits on the website are modelled without bras underneath, including those made from sheer fabric… not exactly gym (or in-public) friendly.\\n\\n3. Despite slogan t-shirts calling for the legalisation of gay marriage and the ‘sweatshop free’ label, there is something less than savoury about American Apparel. Founder and CEO Dov Charney has been involved in a string of sexual harassment lawsuits and in 2004, Jane magazine’s Claudine Ko reported that during an interview with Charney he received oral sex from a female employee and masturbated repeatedly.\\n\\n4. I want to look at tights, not some girl’s arse. Not only do a significant proportion of the female models featured on American Apparel’s UK site look decidedly underage, but the sexualised poses and volume of flesh on show are wholly unnecessary when one considers both the context of the images and the product they are promoting. The ‘Sheer Luxe Cut-Out Pantyhose’ for £19 leave the entirety of the wearer’s bum exposed, and to put issues of design and comfort aside (because they look REALLY uncomfortable), I found myself asking why the accompanying slideshow of images needed to show the model bending over suggestively, with entirely bare breasts. There is no age restriction on accessing the site and interestingly enough, none of the male models are bending over, sucking their fingers or showing their bare bum cheeks.\\n\\n5. You’re only hired if you look right. Charney’s comments regarding only employing the ‘right type of black girl’ are a particularly noxious example. Of course, this is not unique to American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch are a high profile example of a clothing retailer with a gross hiring practice, paying out $40 million in 2004 for refusing to give non-white applicants positions in-store. However, this gives lie to the progressive politics and the declaration that the company are ‘setting a new standard that others will follow’, found on their website.\\n\\n6. Dov Charney doesn’t want his employees talking. In 2010 Gawker ran an article on American Apparel’s ‘At Will Employment Confidentiality Agreement’ which introduces a penalty of $1,000,000 for any American Apparel worker who speaks to the media or disparages Charney in public or online. The agreement also stipulates that when out and about, employees should not discuss the company at a volume that ‘reasonably could be overheard by a third party’. So basically, you have to whisper. Such measures certainly suggest that the company has something to hide.\\n\\nDespite the seething mass of corporate paranoia, rampant misogyny and disturbing sexualisation of young models displayed by American Apparel, I still believe that we can have clothing companies that pay their workers a fair wage without negating this achievement through other types of unethical behaviour. But until Charney makes substantial changes to the way his clothing empire operates, the lurex shine has definitely worn off American Apparel.',\n",

Hormones make me cry at heart-tugging commercials, melt when I see my children play with each other, and be hopelessly sappy and emotional when I even look at my husband. (…now you know why I have three kids). ;)\\n\\nBut there is another set of hormones. The ones I hate. These hormones make me irrational, frustrated, alone, and irritable.

I can’t see through the fog because my fog lights are turned off.\\n\\nI bet there isn’t a woman out there who can’t relate to that. And if you can’t…then DENIAL! LOL! Last week was honestly one of those weeks for me. I completely lost it last Wednesday in the worst possible way. I was overly tired because Christian was sick ONCE AGAIN and I had no clue what it was or how he got it. I wasn’t getting any sleep, because he was fighting sleep. Josh and I were trying to figure out some areas in our homeschooling that have been a struggle for Grace. And I was just done with it all. Ready to toss in the towel and go hide out in my closet until the storm passed.\\n\\nJosh obviously talked me down, LOL and this freak out came after he had brought me home a beautiful bouquet of tulips and frozen yogurt. What a way to say “Thank you” huh? Boy, am I a keeper! But seriously, I had to keep repeating the Bible verse, “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials.”James 1:2 over and over again in my head. I kept telling myself to find the joy in this situation with Christian being sick again and trying to work through the homeschool stuff that was really beating me down.\\n\\nIt was slow-going. It didn’t happen overnight. But by the following evening, I was feeling better and I was counting my blessings. Christian was sick. But I got to cuddle him a lot! And his hugs are so therapeutic. We’re trying to find our way with homeschooling a 4th grader and coming face to face with my inadequacies as the teacher and how some things, I just can’t teach as well, because I’m still trying to learn. But, I get to have my kids home with me everyday, filling our house with joyful noise. Whether it be crying or laughter. We have a beautiful life that is not perfect. Perfection is boring. Perfection means that you have arrived and there is nothing else to learn and no more room to grow. Things may be easier if everything was perfect, but it would certainly be boring.\\n\\nSo wives and mommas, we all have our days, weeks, months, and even years where it seems our hormones get the best of us. But consider it pure joy, to face these trials and find the blessings that are laying low in the fog. They are there.

This scientists have been censored for the ethic implications of the whole thing.\\n\\nThe ethical analysis of the whole thing is very interesting, and you can debate it whether is morally right to create such a being under the pretenses of advancing medical fields. And while I do believe there is much to worry about if this blurs the line of what human rights means or the sanctity of life, a bigger concern arises: I want my fucking Gadget now.\\n\\nWhat? We where all 6 at one point, right?\\n\\nNo, shut up! You mean you guys had been doing fuckin\\' mutants in a lab somewhere for the last 3 years, and you didn\\'t think: \"Hey, maybe we need to be creating a Spider-Man.\"? Like \" Maybe, we\\'re living in a year that starts with 2 Thousand, and we\\'re still without Tigersharks. Maybe we oughta be working on that.\"\\n\\nI mean, I\\'m not one to play God, but if you must play God, go for the win! Embrace it! Ask for funding for the mutanimals project, I\\'m sure I would put some money down to see Ray Fillet in real life.\\n\\nI want to see this \"embryos\". Show me them. You can\\'t be this selfish. Do you think I buy the excuse that you where making manimals just because you cared about vaguely advancing fields of science? You where creating Mona Lisa, weren\\'t you?! Share, dudes.

Putin is an ass, corrupt, violent, and willing and able to use his KBG background to control dissent.

       " 'BioShock Infinite type Video Games\\n\\nOne of the most hotly anticipated games of 2013 is BioShock Infinite, a dark steampunk adventure set in an alternate-universe in 1912 on the flying city of Columbia. It’s the first game that designer Ken Levine has completed since the first BioShock, the Ayn-Rand-Goes-to-Atlantis megahit that is still widely regarded as one of the great achievements in modern gaming. EW got to play the first few hours of Infinite, and then we spoke to Levine about exploring mature themes, the violent videogame controversy, and how Dungeons & Dragons saved his sanity. BioShock Infinite is set for a March 26 release on Windows, PlayStation 3, and XBox 360.\\n\\nImage zoom Lewis Jacobs/NBC\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: I noticed that this game is really pushing some serious issues with the American Exceptionalism theme. Early on you deal with religion and racism; what motivates you to explore these deeper themes?\\n\\nKEN LEVINE: It’s not like we say: ‘Let’s open the deeper themes closet.’ It’s more like we have a story we want to tell and that story takes us to wherever it takes us. We started with the time period and then we started with characters and their motivations and their views on the world. With racism, it was very hard to tell a story in this time period that didn’t deal with that issue. As much as racism still exists, it was so overt back then that you could not miss it. Just go by a bathroom: “coloreds” and “whites,” “no Irish need apply,” those were all real. Let alone the minstrel shows, which was very out there.\\n\\nI thought it was really subtle the way you see the “colored” bathroom first, and it’s horrible, and then later you find the “whites” bathroom and it’s pristine, beautiful. It’s such a nice atmospheric touch.\\n\\nYeah, there are very overt moments of racism and then there’s the more subtle. If you come up to the guy sweeping the floor in one of the bathrooms, he’s like, “You’re going to get us both in trouble if you talk to me.” That nervousness he obviously has. “You’re not supposed to be in this sh***y place, you’re supposed to be in the nice place.” And it’s those little touches you can do in a game. And the reason they’re interesting or meaningful is because you discover them. That second bathroom is not on the critical path; you could have missed it completely. But I think it’s actually rewarding when you find it on your own.\\n\\nIt’s no problem for a movie or a TV show to deal with this kind of thing, but it actually almost felt a little shocking seeing it in a video game. I’ve always found a lot of stories very disposable, and obviously that is the opposite of what your game is trying to do. Do you think people are going to be shocked by this or people are going to take a headline and completely distort it?\\n\\nI think there’s three reason why it comes across as shocking as it does. One of which is, it’s just shocking material in general, what was going on in that time period. And not all across that time period, there were certain parts of the world that were much better and certain parts that were much worse, just like there is today. Then there’s the notion that it’s a video game, you’re sort of not expecting it in the medium, which to me is a shame. Not racism in particular, but just the fact that we feel theme-restricted. And then there’s the third, the nature of it being a video game, the fact that you have agency in these moments, I think makes it even more shocking because you don’t have that protective layer of passivity. So when we have that scene with the baseball, [Early in the game, you attend a carnival and enter a raffle where the winner gets to throw a ball. It turns out you have to decide whether to throw the ball at a bound interracial couple, as the crowd demands, or throw it at the announcer.] The reason we thought it was so important to confront you with that choice was because it said you’re not an observer here, you have to be active, you’re in this world, and you can’t just close your eyes.\\n\\nAnd it’s timed, so there’s even greater urgency.\\n\\nWe don’t have a giant sort of morality system running underneath that tracks all your things and gives you extra powers. I mean there are small changes, like I don’t know which one you chose.\\n\\nTo throw it at the bad guy!\\n\\nI ‘ve never seen a single person [throw it at the couple].\\n\\nI can’t imagine! It’s horrifying to think the way that The Walking Dead [game] tracks the stats, it’d be horrifying to see what that would actually be.\\n\\nI’ve seen nobody do it. What’s interesting is people say to me, what is the moral effect of that, and there is a small effect, meaning that, you probably met the couple later on [If you choose not to throw the ball at the couple, they later meet you and give you a gift as thanks], but that’s very small to me. To me the interesting part is how it makes you feel in all of it. That’s the moral effect, not some number. I wasn’t really interested in a morality system, versus just moments where we confront people with hard or weird or dangerous choices. So I think it’s effective for those reasons. Certainly The Walking Dead is a really interesting example of games that are starting to explore a more interesting range of elements, but we just pursue the things that we’re interested in.\\n\\nOne of the big things I picked up on [in the original BioShock] was the relationship between the Big Daddies and the Little Sisters. It made Big Daddy kind of an iconic character. He’s in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale, which is supposed to be these huge characters from the last few years. I’m wondering what you think character-wise might resonate to that degree from Infinite.\\n\\nI don’t think there’s any one-to-one thing. I think Songbird [a huge winged creature that guards Elizabeth’s prison] has a different role. Elizabeth—people are already cosplaying her left and right—once they actually get through the experience and go through the game with her, I think their feelings for her will get much deeper. And she’ll surprise you in many ways, some good and some bad. These things have an effect on her, and she changes throughout the course of the game. She was certainly the most important to me when I was writing the game. She’s sort of the emotional center of it. I think that she is something quite different than what you see in a lot of games.\\n\\nThe only other game I can think of that did this kind of non-playable character was Half-Life 2 with the Alyx [Vance] character, to whom a lot of people really responded.\\n\\nI think there was game called Enslaved [Ninja Theory’s 2010 action-adventure game] that did a reasonably good job with the character, but I just can’t wait for the game to come out cause I just want people to see Booker and Elizabeth go through their path, their journey through this game and see where they end up.\\n\\nWhen I was in high school was when Mortal Kombat hit Genesis and Super Nintendo, and obviously there was a huge uproar over the violence, and that’s been a huge issue in the media lately following the Newtown shootings. Vice President Biden is looking into it, and Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander recently said video games are “a bigger problem than guns.” Why do you think the industry is such a punching bag for this kind of thing?\\n\\nIndependent of any science or reality or anything, any new form of media is going to be not understood, generally by people who are older. Go back to when the novel first appeared on the scene. It was shocking! People thought that when women were reading it, young wives were reading it and getting all these crazy ideas…\\n\\nPutting notions in their heads!\\n\\nExactly, it was scandalous, and people were like, the novel has to be stopped. The mandarins of taste were up in arms, and the list goes on. Rock and roll music, jazz music, comic books, movies, TV, everything is lesser and not art and not meaningful in some way. And at the same time, Dungeons & Dragons, that movie with Tom Hanks [CBS’ 1982 made-for-TV movie Mazes and Monsters] where people would play Dungeons & Dragons and go insane. It’s heartbreaking for me because as a young kid, I have to say Dungeons & Dragons…I can’t say it saved my life, but it saved my sanity as a kid because I was a friendless little nerd. I was literally friendless, until the ninth grade. And then I was on the bus driving home from school one day and I heard a couple of kids in the front of the bus talking about, “My paladin fought these orcs…” and I was like, what?! And I went up and I introduced myself, and two weeks later I was at a Dungeons & Dragons game with people who would–one of whom would remain my best friend to this day–and it completely transformed my–all of a sudden I had found my people, you know? And to think that that could be viewed as a source of evil is so disappointing and depressing to me.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, science is science, I don’t think research is ever a bad thing. Without video games, without gaming in general, I don’t know where I would end up. I don’t know what I would be. And I’m not talking about like would I be a big success. I don’t know how I would have gotten through high school. Games saved me over and over again. When I had a career in my 20s that was going nowhere, games came in and saved me again. I became a game developer. And for kids–I don’t want to say this is necessarily true of you—nerdy kids with not a lot of social skills, games are a socializing element. Go to PAX, my god. It’s incredibly social. And I think the lack of understanding people have about how most people play games, and how they think about games, is really lacking, and how important it is to kids who don’t have strong social skills.\\n\\nI love the part where Elizabeth pulls open the tear and you see the La revanche du Jedi sign [Early in the game, Elizabeth opens a portal to another time where you see Revenge of the Jedi (Its original title before Return) playing at a movie theater in Paris], and I was just wondering if she would be able to open it to like 2015 and see if the new Star Wars is gonna be any good?\\n\\nWell, she knows, actually. She’s starting a blog about it right now. She’s expressing her rage–her nerd rage. She knows, but she’s not telling.\\n\\nRead more:',\n",

       " 'by Smitty\\n\\nI’m so tired of pieces like “Attacks On Milo Yiannopoulos Are About Homophobia, Not Pedophilia that I’m almost too bored to respond:\\n\\nI’m not enamored of Milo Yiannopoulos – and not only because “gay Jewish conservative opinion writer” was supposed to be MY thing. He often seems more interested in promoting himself than any particular set of ideas, and his unctuous showmanship rubs me the wrong way. And as I said, I deplore his idea that children can consent to sex. But his dis-invitation from CPAC for remarks that have been misinterpreted, that share attitudes not uncommon in America, and that he has apologized for is a dangerous precedent even for a self-proclaimed dangerous faggot.\\n\\nDavid, you’re part of the problem, not the solution.\\n\\nAnd that problem is equating ideas with people. You can privilege people for being gay, and then try to silence all who disagree by accusing them of being homophobic. This puts you in the position of saying “X hasn’t done enough to disprove homophobia,” which is non-falsifiable.\\n\\nI reject the idea of homosexuality because form follows function; the alternatives are feeble fleshly foolishness.\\n\\nI accept homosexuals as human beings because there isn’t anything going on with them that is more or less different than my own, personal foolishness. Just because I haven’t gotten into a specific form of foolishness doesn’t place me above/below anyone else in Eternity. There is plenty of evidence online to back up my assertion here (as though I had something to prove to anyone).\\n\\nWhen we move to the point that we differentiate between sexuality and politics, and simply respect all persons and “spousal units” (even while mostly ignoring them and the offspring), then we can talk about the situation improving.\\n\\nThis whole CPAC kerfuffle is just so much advertising. It’s the GOProud rah-rah again. I shook hands with the chaps. They’re human beings. But the organization as such isn’t interested in elevating individuals or organizations that if feels do not enhance its goals. So, take the free advertising obtained, stage parallel events, and let the market tell the tale on whether the ideas have merit.\\n\\nI can listen to Milo in the same vein I listen to the Dead Kennedys: an interesting viewpoint, and that’s about it. But don’t call people “homophobe” because the don’t feel like trading protein with Milo; the notion may simply be boring.\\n\\nShare this: Share\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nReddit\\n\\n\\n\\nComments',\n",

       " 'Nobody wants to have scabies, but when you do, all hope is not lost. Just most hope. For those of you unsure about what scabies is, it’s caused by a little bug, called an “itch mite,” that burrows into your skin, kind of like that bug that goes into Chekov’s ear in “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.” A little while after the critters get into your skin, little itchy bumps start appearing all over your body. That’s why it’s called an itch mite, because they make things itchy. If they made things chocolaty, it would be called a “chocolate mite.” Scientists who study these things speculate that such a mite would almost certainly cause the most delicious rashes ever.\\n\\nHow do you contract scabies? There are two ways: one is to have skin to skin contact with an infected person. The other is to go swimming in a pool filled with itch mites. This second way is far less common as there is no such thing as a swimming pool filled with itch mites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf scabies sounds disgusting, that’s only because Westerners have a bias against any little bugs that lay their eggs under your skin and then crawl around in there laying more and more eggs, which in turn hatch more and more bugs. Similar biases exist against bedbugs and ringworm. Why? They are God’s creatures just like dolphins and panda bears. If a panda bear crawled into your skin, you probably wouldn’t say, “That’s disgusting.” You would say, “That’s adorable,” especially if it was a little panda bear cub (which really would be adorable). In fact, kangaroos and other marsupials literally keep their babies in pouches, which is kind of like having scabies. Does that mean duck-billed platypuses are disgusting? Yes, but not because they remind us of itch mites, but because they are so fucking stupid-looking.\\n\\nWhat to do if you have scabies? The first thing you should do is write a blog about it, informing people about what scabies is, and why you’re not disgusting just because you have bugs crawling all over you. The second thing you should do is see a doctor (I recommend Dr. Liebowitz). Normal treatment for scabies includes antibiotics and all the ice cream you can eat. The antibiotics will kill the mites and the ice cream will fill the empty hole in your heart. After that, you need to hire a Mexican girl to clean your entire house for you. If a Mexican girl is unavailable, Guatemalans are also good. Don’t do your own cleaning because that makes you look cheap.\\n\\nAs I said, scabies doesn’t mean the end of hope. It just means you will never be loved again.',\n",

It’s a bit of baloney but there’s a hint of truth to it to.This was the feeling when Little scored shorthanded.Teams and players build reputations, images and and their persona with fans, coaches, GMs, and referees. It’s not deliberate, maybe for some it is, but think of reputations like these general stereotypes in the NHL.Crosby is a whinerE. Kane is an arrogant prickKessel doesn’t trySeguin is immatureThe list goes on so why should referees not have similar impressions about a team when it does the same thing over and over and over again? So if the Jets, and their fans, think the refs are after them, don’t give them something to go after. That being said there were soft calls but that happens and remember it’s not 2005 where nearly EVERYTHING was being called.It may not have been good but not this eye-poppingNikolai Ehlers, the highly touted rookie from the Halifax Mooseheads, got his first NHL goal and unlike teammate Nic Petan it was a gorgeous bar down slapshot that ‘ol King Henrik had no chance of stopping, and on the PP too.This wasn’t the only good thing Ehlers did as late in the game with Lundqvist pulled Ehlers beat the call to stop and icing and then ragged the puck agains 4 Rangers before getting it out where Stuart got the glory.But that WWE tag team effort in the corner was worth it when Stuuuu scored who BTW has more goals than Perreault now…Stuuuuu isn’t the only defenseman being maligned right now and despite getting an assist in the second Little goal Byfuglien has his share of critics again.Buff is struggling and yeah, maybe he needs half a game a forward so he appreciates his position a bit more, he is keeping that future contract value down though.Wheeler had some possible highlights tonight and rarely does anyone question his effort no matter how misguided it sometimes appears.But having goen 3-1 to open the season on a 4 game road trip out east even the Jets harshest and most vocal critics took time to praise the effort. They should, as should all fans of the team as this was a very well managed effort tonight and in two other games after the opening minutes passed. Credit to the Rangers they threw everything at the Jets and Michael Hutchinson and the goalie stood tall in a spectacular effort.\",\n",

       " 'We’re all past the point of digesting Nicki Minaj’s questionable personal style and overt sexuality; its not for everyone and pretty much is what it is. I’m not on “Team Barbie” but there’s something about Nicki that I like — she’s cute, does what she wants, has a few great verses and owns her sexuality in a way that just barely fits with empowered feminism. Still, as much as I “like” her, I can only listen to so much of her music and look at so much of her booty flashing before I feel as ridiculous as she looks with super-pale pink lipstick on.\\n\\nHer new video, “Stupid Hoe” is just straight up confusing and makes me think that she may have jumped her own shark. Not only does the song itself sound like a more-vulgar version of her Big Sean collaboration “A$$” — and I mean just like it — but watching the video kind of feels like torture — I mean the Clockwork Orange, Guantanamo Bay kind. See for yourself but please note, the video posted below is the explicit version because I don’t think there would be enough words left to understand it if the dirty words were removed.\\n\\nIs anyone else as confused as I am after watching this? Is this whole song a Lil’ Kim diss (stupid hoes is my enemy/stupid hoes is so wack/stupid hoe shoulda befriended me/then she coulda prolly came back)? Because the idea that Nicki Minaj is devoting any music whatsoever to perpetuating beef between the two of them hurts my soul and feels like little more than a hip-hop Real Housewives brand of drama. I get the Grace Jones reference and don’t find it as ridiculous as some of the other imagery she uses, but there’s something about this video that feels like the parody of a Nicki Minaj video and not the real video itself.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that this video has over seven million views on YouTube already, but around 60,000 likes and 120,000 dislikes. I can’t tell if folks aren’t feeling it because of the aural assault from the track, the lazy rhymes, the epileptic camera work, or simply because of lameness of a title like “Stupid Hoe.” It’s all a bit embarrassing. Every artist releases a dud here and there, but has Nicki Minaj gone completely off the rails with this one?',\n",

       " 'Op-ed: Antitrans RadFems Are on the Wrong Side of History\\n\\nRadical feminists cling to notions of biological essentialism: that there is a common core of experience that all cisgender women share, and that male-to-female transsexuals can never participate in this and thus always are and will be males. It\\'s not exactly clear when kicking the political crap out of trans women became either \"radical\" or \"feminist,\" but it probably originated 40 or so years ago with Janice Raymond\\'s book The Transsexual Empire.\\n\\nThat initiated a period in my life in the 1980s and \\'90s when it was virtually impossible for me to attend any lesbian or women\\'s event without someone bringing up that book and its noxious arguments. A long, impassioned debate about me and the meaning of my body and my attendance would ensue, often by very well intentioned women, and as often as not ending in my being publicly asked, or told, to leave.\\n\\nThis kind of debate is pretty much the same trick Michelle Goldberg pulls off in the controversial New Yorker piece, \"What Is a Woman?\" The article details the trials and tribulations of self-described RadFems against trans activists and their allies — apparently it\\'s becoming very difficult to participate in polite society. She quotes both sides at length (well, sort of), being very well intentioned in moderating the \"debate,\" as if the arguments put forth are equally valid and neither she nor The New Yorker need take sides. Her tone is one of utter moral passivity.\\n\\nIn effect, it\\'s precisely the kind of article that would have been run 20 years ago about gays and lesbians. It would have quoted homophobic bigots saying that homosexuality was a disease and/or a lifestyle choice, and gay rights activists saying otherwise, and both sides would have been given equal treatment.\\n\\nIn other words, this article is — in its quiet, quasi-liberal intelligentsia way — nearly as transphobic and bigoted as the RadFems whose trials it covers.\\n\\nBut interestingly, these RadFems are finding themselves on the wrong end of history. An ever-dwindling segment of polite society is willing to continue refusing to acknowledge transgender people. We\\'re not exactly taking the courts by storm, as is the case with gay marriage, but we\\'re definitely on an upswing here. Who knows, \"normal\" might be just around the next few corners.\\n\\nAs a result, RadFems are going through — well, pretty much exactly the kind of thing I did 20 years ago. Every time they show up at an event, particularly at lesbian or women\\'s groups, someone brings up RadFems\\' noxious arguments. A long, impassioned debate about them and the meaning of their positions and attendance ensues, often by very well-intentioned women, and often ending with them being asked (or told) to leave.\\n\\nEven Raymond herself is now being disinvited to and barred from events. I mean, does the long arc of the moral universe bends toward justice, or what?\\n\\nToday\\'s truly radical feminism is being waged by young people who see transgender rights coextensive with theirs.\\n\\nFor example, when a Quaker college refused to acknowledge the transition of a young FTM and insisted he was still female, student protesters repeatedly turned out to protest the decision and have dogged the administration\\'s every step. They\\'ve picketed with signs that read, among other things, \"Trans Rights Are Feminist Rights.\" When I read that, it kind of takes my breath away on several levels.\\n\\nThe trans-haters aren\\'t done yet by any means. But the tables are turning. Transphobes are set to become the new trannies. Watch out what you wish for. What goes around comes around. Yes, it does take nearly forever. Revenge really is a dish served cold. But it does come around.\\n\\nNow, will someone please pass me another plate of cold RadFem revenge?\\n\\nRIKI WILCHINS is an activist, stand-up comedian, and author of Read My Lips.',\n",

How can the sun be 149,000,000 miles away and yet there be nothing in-between, separating the two.\\n\\nSo, i asked him about it.\\n\\nHe stuck to his guns. It was all just empty space. Nothing.\\n\\nSo, i said something along the lines of, \"o.k. so it appears there is nothing in between us, empty space right...? but we know that there are actually a bunch of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, blah, blah blah.... so even though we cannot see it there is something there. So, what are the particles that make up space? It has to be something, otherwise all the stars and planets and such would be touching - if there were in fact nothing, a complete vacuum, in between all these objects. So, what\\'s that stuff?\"\\n\\nHe stuck to his guns.\\n\\nI stuck to mine.\\n\\nHe stayed in class.\\n\\nHe sent me to the office.\\n\\nYup, i\\'ve always been punished, in some way, for asking questions.\\n\\nTry it!

       " 'by Joe Starr Geekscape’s Before First Class – What If An Avengers Movie Was Made In The 80s?!?\\n\\nWith an announced sequel to X Men: First Class, and the rumors of a rebooted 1960’s Fantastic Four, retro Marvel is officially IN. This has led Geekscape to wonder: what if different Marvel franchises had actually been released in the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s?\\n\\nOr, maybe you think it’s stupid to cast a Marvel movie in a different decade, justify the lineup, and pitch a plot. Well, that’s why we at Geekscape consider ourselves to be heroes, in a way. We waste our time doing the stupid things the world is afraid to do. Last time, we shook the 90’s to their very core with a 1994 X Men film. Time to step back a decade!\\n\\nTHE 80’S: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!\\n\\nThe Pitch: After a battle to take down Ultron results in an absurd amount of collateral damage, the Avengers reluctantly agree to accept government oversight in the form of Henry Gyrich. The Vision attempts to bring stability to the world by taking control of its computer systems, but is being manipulated by Ultron! It’s the Avengers vs. a Vision-Ultron-Skynet! Will the Avengers prevail? Meanwhile, a young Wanda Maximoff is taken in by the team and falls for the android! Can Scarlet Witch use the human power of love to bring Vision to his senses? And when she does, can the song ‘Power of Love’ play? When I think Avengers, I think Huey Lewis. And his news.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA\\n\\nIn the 80’s, there was only one man that could sling the shield. The only man that John Connor trusted enough to go back in time and bang his mom: Michael Biehn. He is the unsung action hero badass of the 80’s and also The Rock from the 90’s. I mean the movie The Rock. He wasn’t The Rock, though I can still smell what he was cooking. Come on. Picture him doing that monologue to Ed Harris from The Rock in Cap’s costume and you will get a nerd boner.\\n\\nDon’t fight it. It’s natural.\\n\\nIRON MAN\\n\\nAvengers Assemble? AS YOU WISH. Cary Elwes would have been an awesome Tony Stark back in the day. The wit, the arrogance, and the massive amount of girls wanting to bang him. Plus, most of the Dread Pirate Robert’s lines could probably double as Stark lines, so we save on screenwriters. That way in the spin off we get to see Iron Man challenge the Mandarin to a fight to the pain.\\n\\nGYRICH\\n\\nI’m doing my best to justify a Henry Gyrich in every decade I cast a movie in. Charlie Chaplin will end up playing him by the end of this. But before the Dictator gets his shot, the role belongs to John Ritter. Ritter’s been killing it on Three’s Company and it’s time to show his range as a greasy, back stabbing government yes man! This could be his ‘Razor’s Edge!’\\n\\nTHE VISION\\n\\nI wish there was a guy we could call that does robots good…\\n\\nSCARLET WITCH\\n\\nMia Sara! Too young? No way. It takes a dumb teenage girl to fall deeply in love with a robot, and Mia Sara’s career has been built on poor romantic choices: first Tom Cruise in Legend, and then Ferris Bueller, a husband who no doubt will eventually look into a camera and say ‘who could be faithful on a day like this?’ Mia has a perfect wide eyed spaciness for a young woman struggling with chaos magic. Is it chaos magic? I’m really not sure at this point. THANKS BENDIS.\\n\\nBesides, no one complained when two teenage boys fell in love took a shower with Lisa in Weird Science. There’s no room for your double standards in THE AVENGERS.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne more for the road.\\n\\nULTRON\\n\\nNext.\\n\\nBEAST\\n\\nLike, Jeff Bridges, man! Change him out of the Tron suit and put some blue fur on the guy. The Beast abides, man. The Beast abides.\\n\\nHAWKEYE\\n\\nSomething something winning something something dismissive wank. Charlie is a bad ass, and if you remember Hot Shots Part Deux (AND YOU SHOULD) you will remember that he is also dry and hilarious. He’ll also be perfect as part of our important subplot I just figured out: That Hawkeye hates young cocky scientist Hank Pym for having Janet, and is going to murder him when the hitting starts. And you know the hitting will start.\\n\\nYELLOWJACKET\\n\\nAnd when I think of hitting women, I think of Rob Lowe. A dashing scientist, inventor of size changing stuff, and a Duke Silver level saxophone player, Lowe has all the tools needed to play a sleazy piece of shit that needs some redemption. Literally, my favorite person for this role.\\n\\nI CAN’T DEAL WITH INVENTING ULTRON! JUST LET ME ROCK THE PAIN AWAY!\\n\\nTHE WASP\\n\\nJanet needs to be someone you really, really want to bang and really, really hate Hank Pym for being able to bang. I’m going with Demi Moore to keep the Brat Pack repping in this summer blockbuster. And it’s not so much that Demi would be an awesome person to hit, but she could sell a backhand super good. Just thinking about it makes me want to kill Rob Lowe.\\n\\nWONDER MAN\\n\\nMy understanding of Wonder Man isn’t the best, but based on the pre Secret Invasion Mighty Avengers, he’s a smug hacky actor turned super hero and I think he should be Kurt Russell. Please refer yourself to Jack Burton. Clean yourself up, and then see him in Sky High. And then clean yourself up. What? That Scott Pilgrim chick was in it.\\n\\nDIRECTOR\\n\\nEvery movie needs a director (Except for the three Transformers films and anything I shoot of myself crying). The insane amount of androids and evil AI points to Ridley Scott for this thing. He’s the obvious choice for this epic, and while my heart says John Carpenter, my mind is keeping it Ridley.\\n\\nNext time: It’s Warren Ellis’ Thunderbolts… 70’s grindhouse style!',\n",

If you are trying to master the art of the MILF pick up, you really need to throw away all the preconceptions you have in your mind. You really do. A lot of guys fail again and again because they have all these preexisting ideas regarding what MILFs are and what they want and how to approach them. This makes for a very confusing situation.\\n\\nUnfortunately, if you’re confused about a particular objective, you’re just making it all that much harder on yourself to achieve that objective. Do you see where I’m coming from? If you really want to understand the art of the MILF pick up, pay attention to the following 3 stories.\\n\\nStory #1\\n\\nOvercome your fear. The first time I met this hot MILF, I was just intimidated. She had it going on. She was making $200,000 a year running her own business. She was really good looking and I thought that I didn’t have half a chance.\\n\\nAccordingly, I acted like a total and complete loser and, guess what happened? I blew my chance. The lesson? You have to believe that you can achieve. You have to believe that you are desirable. Otherwise, you have no business trying to pick up on MILFs.\\n\\nStory #2\\n\\nI went on a date with a MILF and, for some reason or another, I thought she told me that she wanted to fuck me. It turns out, after I’ve banged her, that she didn’t say it. She didn’t actually tell me that she wanted to fuck me, but when I got that idea in my head, that’s all I could think about. That’s all I focused on and, guess what happened? I ended up sticking my dick in her.\\n\\nWhat’s the lesson in this story? If you truly believe in something, your actions will fall into place and whatever you believe becomes reality. This is not the law of attraction bullshit. This is real.\\n\\nStory #3\\n\\nI hung out with this chick and fucked the shit out of her and I made it a point to make her orgasm back to back for about 8 times. It almost killed me, but I was able to do it and guess what happened? She invited her friends over the next time. That’s right, I banged 4 women at the same time.\\n\\nThe lesson here is when you give women what they’re looking for, they will invite their friends. This is, of course, all about adult dating, MILF dating to be exact as displayed here: http://www.fuckaMILF.net . This is not regular dating.\\n\\nI want you guys to take a long, hard look at Karen. She is in her mid 50’s and loves having sex. The sad thing about it is she is having a hard time (no pun intended) finding willing men to satisfy her pussy. I think it’s a crying shame that there’s a shortage of men that are willing to open up and have a sexual experience with an older woman. I’ve been there and done it and guys… there’s nothing strange or wrong about it. You’d actually be surprised at how good these girls are in bed.\\n\\nWhile she’s a naughty wife on MatureLover.co.uk as I mentioned before there isn’t many men on the site that can give her the cravings that her pussy has. I bet if you and maybe a few of your buddies joined you could get laid in no time at all. Karen is open to being with more than one man at a time and honestly, I think her pussy would totally love it.\\n\\nThere are not many things in life these days that are certain, at least you can be almost certain that these real milfs will want to milk your cock all night long. There’s no time to waste though, once the word is out you can bet there’s going to be loads of guys trying to get hook up sex with any of the 100’s of milfs that are online now. Get in first so your dick is at the top of the list for these mature sluts to play with!\\n\\nGranny On Cam\\n\\nAdult content. Visitors who are not 18 years old, please leave this website now.

Moesha Boduong\\n\\nThe truth is; if you are asked to state something of importance that Moesha has done to deserve the slightest of fame she enjoys today, you wouldn’t be able to name any, even if given a century to think about it.\\n\\nShe’s just famous for having a big ass, hips and posting racy photos on instagram.\\n\\nYou can say, she is famous for being dumb.\\n\\n2. Mona Aka Hajia4Real\\n\\nTo think of it, most of us got to know of Mona Aka Hajia4Real when she was brutally dissed by Amanda Acquah in an audio sent to Ghanaian millionaire-Kenpong.\\n\\nSo literally, she is famous for being dissed and for dating a rich man.\\n\\nFrom there, the instagram followers started pouring in and she shot to the ceiling on the fame radar.\\n\\nToday, she is an instagram celebrity…\\n\\n3. Amanda Acquah\\n\\nAmanda’s relationships with Kenpong and Ghanaian footballer-Afriyie Acquah are not the true reasons why a lot of people know her name.\\n\\nShe is known for scandals upon scandals, with her insulting audio to Kenpong leading the pack.\\n\\nShe has also had two or three scandalous inappropriate materials leaking–which made her the talk of Ghana.\\n\\n4. Menaye Donkor\\n\\nWhy do we celebrate Menaye Donkor? Nothing?\\n\\nDon’t say because she is married to a Ghanaian footballer–because several others are married to footballers and we don’t see them anywhere in the news.\\n\\nMenaye Donkor has made it to the room of Ghanaian Celebrities by riding on the back of her husband and also by association with other celebrities.\\n\\nSo she’s like a celebrity by association, a socialite.5. Princess Shyngle\\n\\nPrincess Shyngle has made it as far as being covered by the world’s most read online news website-DailyMail.\\n\\nAnd it’s not for anything worth celebration–but her ridiculous hips got her there.\\n\\nThe Mail Online called her “an actress, a writer and producer” and to be frank, we can’t name any of her works.\\n\\nDeborah Vanessa\\n\\n6. Deborah Vanessa\\n\\nDeborah Vanessa claims to be everything; a model, actress, musician, writer, TV presenter and a producer–when in fact, she is not really any of these things.\\n\\nEven if she has had stints with any of the fields above, her success does not merit the sort of celebrity bandage she wears on her arms.\\n\\nShe is riding on a free wave of fame, backed by nothing.\\n\\nNana Akua Addo\\n\\n7. Nana Akua Addo\\n\\nNana Akua Addo has tried her hands on a few acting and producing gigs but she has not scored any success and therefore has not been able to generate attention from that sector.\\n\\nYet, she wears the celebrity chain around her neck–mostly, by making glam appearances at events, all cost paid by herself.\\n\\nSo literally, she is famous for being at every event and not for what she says she is actually involved in.\\n\\nI doubt you’ve seen any of her movies.\\n\\nBibi Bright\\n\\n8. Bibi Bright\\n\\nNo doubt Nana Akua Addo and Bibi Bright have become enemies–they are all in desperate want of the same throne–the throne of celebrities for no reason.\\n\\nBibi Bright has also tried her hands on acting and producing; nothing impressive or worth of any attention.\\n\\nBut she has succeeded in stealing social media attention with n*de photos, fights and her ‘basaa’ English.\\n\\n9. Madam Akua Donkor\\n\\nMadam Akua Donkor is perhaps even more popular than Ghana’s Vice President-Amissah Arthur and PPP’s Paa Kwesi Nduom. She is one of the most media covered personalities in Ghana today–but for what reason?\\n\\nShe’s really famous or a celebrity for being empty–and that defeats the true essence of celebrity-ship.\\n\\nShe even travels with the President on diplomatic missions…\\n\\nBy: konkonsagh.biz | 9 Ghanaian Celebrities Who Are Famous for No Reasonp; No3-9 Will Give You Headache',\n",

So, clearly this is the day that I have to watch what is easily the most twisted and fucked up claymation video I’ve ever witnessed.\\n\\nCalled One of Two Evils and directed by Christoph Younes, the story is about a young boy who makes a sinister wish after his parents, who are in the midst of a divorce, end up taking out their anger and frustrations on him. What follows is a series of visuals that are beyond NSFW. Seriously, I felt uncomfortable watching it and it’s my job to see things like this!\\n\\nThe synopsis for One of Two Evils reads:\\n\\nOne Of Two evils is a horror stop motion animation short. The film follows the story of a young boy who is currently witnessing his parents go through a divorce. Due to being lonely, isolated, and ignored, his imagination takes over and his version of events that happen suddenly take a sinister turn. The film is an experimental film that looks at the content of family, isolation and divorce and how it’s a messy affair, hence the rough finish and smudged characters relating back to the content of the film.\\n\\nI’m going to warn you that there are some incredibly adult themes here, such as rape, possession, child molestation, and more crammed into this video.',\n",

He\\'s packing 11\" !\\n\\njust have to make do with my normal 7 by 6 inch dick sorry ladies and even though i am above average i have been called small by one past partner , if thats all you girls think about then its a sad world. If someone made a mold of his penis I would try it just to test it because mybe I could get a better idea of what the real thing might be like. I saw a pic of it somewhere online today and holy shit it is scary, I left a message for Jonah right away on facebook explaining I would consider showing him mine sence Ive seen his.4 god sake I was just looking 4 porn!!!!!!research states that having a bigger penis can infact push out the sperm of the competition and was used to impress the opposite sex back in the caveman age something like that anyway. so did you people see how lond 9 inches is comparing to a normal girl looks fu..ing freaky i dont talk about 13.5 inches join the fu..ing zoo i dont want to hear any one wishes for that ever again. I am sorry to announce you, but he is second place now, in Romania a guy named Ion Hiugidichea that has a 15.3 inch penis, he now came in 1st place, but... when i was in Turkey on a nudist beach i saw an old man with a gigantic penis, and everyone was taking pictures with him he was at least 16 inch flacid, so please do your documentary before you make a video. I\\'ve heard some bimbos in my time, but this idiot takes the cake. Just shut your mouth little girl, do us all a favor!!\\n\\nGuys, get your facts right: Jonah Falcon is the owner of the world\\'s largest - natural - penis. Pornstars use so much shit to enlarge their junk - this man was born with the fucking thing.\\n\\nShes fuckin gorgeous, she looks like a ripe juicy fruit all full of goodness. Wow Id love to fuck her.cmon guys! srsly now i hv seen at porn videos black dudes with cocks bigger than my sofa!(its an illness btw but they still have bigger cocks than this in the vid). I have to disagree with the Asian part. I\\'ve seen more than a handful of Koreans with big penises. I\\'m just saying lol don\\'t ask me how. I just have xD. a AVERAGE penis B===D JOHNA FALCON\\'S penis B==============D a AVERAGE penis, FLACCID, B=D JONAH FALCON\\'S penis flaccid B=====D. Hmmm with that mouth I\\'m sure it would fit (c\\'mon I just said it blunt, the other guys are thinking the same and you talking are about the largest penis... what did you expect?). 2 styles have fun with erection problems sonshine. a penis over 10 inches long needs too much blood pumped into it for an erection and people who are over 10 inches long develop erection problems by the age of 25. so you fail. go home. There are many “porn stars” who claim, to be bigger, but they are using a silicone Prosthesis.\\n\\nIt would be shit having a dick that big, I swear you could kill a girl if you put it fully in! And with regular sex you would only ever be able to get the tip of it in, so you would never be fully satisfied. :(. for fcks sake \"women on youtube\" no one cares about what your saying... Its just tits or gtfo and thats all it will ever be. Women are for sex.A couple of quick points: 1) I was in the same documentary as Mr. Falcon... the consenus (even among producers) is that he isn\\'t as large as he claims. That\\'s why he never shows it. Think about it... I was only around twice the average erect size, btw. 2) Your penis size by region talk is HILARIOUS. Purely coincidence that the countries who proclaim the larges penis size also worship birds and cure disease by witchcraft. Oh, what I mean... It\\'s self reported!!!!!! LOL.\\n\\nAugust 31, 2013.

All opinions are my own.\\n\\nComments\\n\\nI am VERY tempted to try this workout. But I was told when I went to Crossfit that my squat form is terrible and now I am scared to do them. Any tips?\\nI take my vitamins in the morning, first thing. Before coffee. It is the only way I get it done consistently.\\n\\nI just watched it! I am tickled at how you can stay down in that squat and keep talking. They did tell me that about sticking my ass out first. Said it would look stupid but help. My husband wants to go to the gym tonight (I ran 5 miles on the trail this morning). I may have to try and get through some of this.\\nThanks!The Kidless KroniclesNicole@TheKidlessKronicles recently posted..Sloth Sunday: Success!\\n\\nI take my ProSculpt at 430am pre-crossfit… then protein after… and aminos during. I have a hard time remembering to take my vitamins because I can’t take them first thing in AM as they conflict with my thyroid meds… still working on figuring that one out. I should set a phone alarm (DUH-COURTNEY!) lolCourtney @ Journey of a Dreamer recently posted..Weekly Workout Recap\\n\\nGreat workout as always! I love protein pancakes! I have just discovered them and will try your version. I just mash 1 banana and mix in 2 eggs, protein and 2 tablespoons of almond meal. Great breakfast or snack and lots of protein!!\\nThe only vitamins I take are spirulina in the morning. I prefer vitamins that are natural and not synthetic, although I do need to take magnesium when I remember to stop cramps!Lyn recently posted..Clean Eating Grocery List\\n\\nI am going to try this tonight. I’m a little scared. Thankfully my husband is mountain biking after work so I should be able to get it done before he gets home with only the cats to laugh at me!\\n\\nI split my vitamins, I take a couple in the morning and the rest at night. I don’t really have a “go to” pre or post workout meal. Sometime I don’t want to eat for hours after, especially when I run. That’s not good.\\n\\nCan’t wait to try this tomorrow!! Did your power circuit one today with an incline walk!! Love the feeling in my shaky legs after these workouts! I take my vitamins in the am and pm. My fav post meal is chocolate protein shake with PB2 and a banana!\\n\\nIt’s sogood that Cooper gets supplements too. An animals joints need so much care since they have four legs forcing their backs to sway down and thei little hips to pick up the slack. I think I might listen to too many animal shows.\\n\\nI love your workouts and can’t wait to try this one! My only hesitation is the sit-ups. I have read recently that sit-ups can be bad for your back and that it is better to do planks to work on your core instead. Thoughts?? You would know much more about this topic than I would! I’m not prone to back injuries and have never had problems in the past…Kristen @ Happy Running Mama recently posted..Full Circle\\n\\nWhere did you read that sit-ups were bad? I’d like to read more on the source. I definitely think planks rock and have their place, but full sit-ups are super effective too! Much more so than a “crunch”. you can subbed something else for the sit-ups if you want!\\n\\nHi Jordan. I really like GNC supplements/vitamins which is why I listed them, but I would never recommend any supplement because I am not an RD. However, I try to share what works for me personally in hopes others can use that info!\\n\\nIt’s always a good day when Jess has a new workout up! I love this one!\\nI am really in a vitamin slump right now – I was taking them (multi and fish oil) but my stomach started really hurting from them after a few weeks. Weird, right? I laid off and the pain went away, and haven’t got back on the bandwagon since, though I know I really should. What could this be from?\\n\\nAnother area I have to clean up is eating in general…too much Halloween chocolate! My pre-workout snacks are really not that great. Before my early morning swims, it’s usually just a few dates or a banana! Always room for improvement…Addy @ Six-Kick Switch recently posted..High Sierra Challenge\\n\\nI love these workouts. Keep ‘em coming! With a knee injury post-marathon, I’m focusing on strength training. I am also on a mission to have defined arms when wedding season hits this summer, as I’ll be maid of honor in my best friend’s wedding!\\n\\nHoly moly. Never tried a ladder workout and I tried this countdown home workout today. So challenging! ..in a good way. I pretty quickly had to revert to push ups on the knees, but finished from 10 to 1. Phew!\\nthanks\\n\\nI just googled “simple home crossfit workout” and got to you…just did this but used a 20lb bar for squats. Very excellent workout. We are snowed in and this simple quick high intensity workout was perfect.\\n\\nTacked this on to the end of a arms strength workout — such a great way to squeeze in a little HIIT! Took me 12 minutes and it feels like about 10 minutes of burpees haha.Abby recently posted..She Reads Truth: Women of Scripture\\n\\nSo happy to find your blog! Spent the last two years really focusing on my personal fitness. Dropped 3o lbs and cleaned up my eating. Since I have gotten married, I have slacked off some. However, your blog has given me an extra boost to really get going again! Time to train for a half-marathon with my husband! finished the workout in 9 min 50 sec- felt fantastic afterwards\\n\\nI’ve been doing the summer workout series and today doing this workout was the first day I could do 10 burpees in a row without needing a breather! I did it all from 10 to 1 (had to take a minute break at the 6 rep mark) but I was so excited to be able to do all the burpees without stopping half way through them! Thanks so much for posting these workouts. I can already see improvement in just two weeks of incorporating strength!!!

       " 'Sports and human rights: give me back my orange!\\n\\nThe color of orange is hijacked by criminals supporting morons. This is why I state this:\\n\\nAll over the world we have nations. Nations with laws. Laws to protect the rights of the citizens of these nations. And where there are no laws we see chaos. Some nations, in fact many, have terrible laws. Nations that abuse human rights of some of their citizens. Nations like Russia, Poland and the Ukraine.\\n\\nAnd then we have sports. International sports. With it’s own laws setting itself apart from society. Organized around large amounts of money and exercising their financial powers to push governments to their desire. That goes for the International Olympic Committee and that goes for international soccer. International sports knows a lot of corruption simply because when there’s a lot of money flowing, corruption is always around. The FIFA knows that and so does the UEFA. So often they organize major sports events in countries that are well known for their lawlessness, human rights abuse and corruption. One of the main events in Europe this year is obviously the European Soccer Championships. The location is Poland together with the Ukraine. The argument that the international sports federations use to defend themselves when organizing events in human rights violation countries are always the same: it is for the good of the people living in those countries. Therebye underlining the position of sports as not being bound by international law. The FIFA is the worst as they actually demand countries to change their laws, but UEFA is not much better.\\n\\nSo this year the soccer players have shifted to Poland and Ukraine. The Ukraine where a list of governments has an equally long list of human rights violations and political oppression. Where political opponents are abused and thrown into jail, tortured and sometimes killed. Where free speech is absent and free press is hindered when it addresses government initiated crime. The Ukraine being a country that – just like Poland – is increasingly homophobic and transphobic. Where violence against homosexuals, lesbians and transgenders is not being addressed by the government but silently supported. And sometimes not even silently but explicitly with police force. The Ukraine is working on draconic laws against any public display or discussion of gay and trans rights. Even supported by the political party of Mrs. Timosjenko who is herself in jail being the victim of her own government (after having been responsible of victimizing others when she was ruling). This is what the Ukrainian parliament will be discussing any time soon:\\n\\nBill # 8711 proposes:\\n\\n1. To ban any production or publication of products promoting homosexuality;\\n2. To ban the use of media, TV or radio broadcasting for homosexuality promotion;\\n3. To ban printing or distribution publications promoting pornography, cult of violence and cruelty or homosexuality;\\n4. To ban import, production or distribution of creative writings, cinematography or video materials promoting homosexuality.\\n\\nBill # 10290 determines the forms of homosexuality promotion as follows:\\n1. holding meetings, parades, actions, pickets, demonstrations and other mass gatherings, which are directed to and/or are expressed in intentional dissemination of any positive information about homosexuality, which may negatively influence physical and mental health, moral and spiritual growth of children;\\n2. holding educational lessons, thematic conversations, interactive games, optional classes, other educational events on homosexuality;\\n3. messages, articles or appeals spreading in any form the call for homosexual lifestyle in mass media, which may negatively influence physical and mental health, moral and spiritual growth of children;\\n4. spreading information in any form about homosexuality or of the call for homosexual lifestyle in institution of general education, which may negatively influence physical and mental health, moral and spiritual growth of children.\\n\\nIf adopted, the laws will introduce steep fines (up to 100 net minimum incomes or 300 net minimum incomes) or imprisonment up to five years for “homosexual propaganda”.\\n\\nNow obviously these proposed laws are directly violating the basic rights of homosexuals and transgenders in the Ukraine. The international sports associations like UEFA don’t care about that. The soccer players, their team managers and trainers, there staff and their supporters do not speak up. They just celebrate their freedom based on the financial and corrupted power invested by UEFA. They vandalize society, they incriminate their countries in supporting a government that is abusing it’s own people and they are in fact – by staying silent and being in the Ukraine – passively supporting the government of that country. It makes them co-conspiracers of a government that incriminates gays and transgenders.\\n\\nWhich is why I don’t give a shit about international sports events and why I do not want to be associated with the European Soccer Championships at all. It is why I do not support the Dutch soccer team that is in my views composed of a bunch of rich hippocrites. Which is also why I hope they are ousted asap and the color orange is given back to the rest of the people after being hijacked by a bunch of criminal supporting idiots.\\n\\nI want my orange back, without the filth attached to it caused by soccer supporters.',\n",

Critical thinking has failed to explain the existence of the Wolf to me. I have to free my mind to understand it. Once I do, I will have a deeper understanding of golf discs, life and the Universe.

Dave D designed it one day after visiting a mexican shaman and had a vision quest to design the wolf (he named it after his spirit guide animal).

The messiah will eventually be betrayed by his seventh disciple on the seventh day of the seventh month of his seventh seventh year on this earth.

       " 'This was my column, as approved by my editor, that the Courant refused to publish about one of its biggest advertisers. It was scheduled to run on Aug. 2 but was held without an explanation. This was the first time in my 40 years at The Courant that an investigation by the attorney general was withheld from the public.\\n\\nState Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says he has launched an investigation into consumer complaints that Sleepyâ€™s sold mattresses or box springs that were used instead of new, and in one case infested with bedbugs.\\n\\nBlumenthal said last month that he has up to 10 recent complaints against Sleepyâ€™s, the largest mattress chain in the United States, with 74 stores in Connecticut.\\n\\nA letter from Adam S. Blank, Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer. Please click here. A letter from Stern Environmental Group to Sleepy’s customer Jeff Maier. Please click here.\\n\\nâ€œWe have received a number of complaints, up to 10, that mattresses maybe have been used, with groves and deep depressions,â€\\x9d Blumenthal said in an interview with me.\\n\\nPrior to that interview I asked Blumenthal to check to see whether any other mattress retailers had complaints filed against them of giving customers used mattresses or of bed bug infestation.\\n\\nâ€œSleepyâ€™s was the only oneâ€\\x9d the attorney general replied.\\n\\nSleepyâ€™s denies it has ever sold a used mattress and says its inspection and quality control process would make it impossible for someone to receive a product infested with bedbugs. It says there has never been a proven case of bedbug infestations caused by their merchandise.\\n\\nSleepyâ€™s, with 700 stores nationwide, says that the number of complaints against it is tiny compared to the hundreds of thousands of mattresses the company sells each year. And almost all of the complaints were resolved.\\n\\nBlumenthalâ€™s investigation into Sleepyâ€™s operations is the second in Connecticut since 2004 when the company paid a $4,000 fine to consumer protection.\\n\\nTwo years ago Sleepyâ€™s, according to the Better Business Bureau, paid a $200,000 fine to New York City consumer officials as part of a settlement.\\n\\nThe BBB said that the company faced charges that it used â€œdeceptive sales tactics, including exchanging defective mattresses with equally defective mattresses; charging additional delivery fees to consumers for exchanging damaged mattresses; failing to deliver items when scheduled and not properly informing or offering customers store credit or refund; and refusing to honor manufacturer warranties because of alleged stains.\\n\\nJeff Maier, a Norwalk small businessman, asked Blumenthal to investigate Sleepyâ€™s last December because he and his wife had a â€˜â€™severeâ€™â€™ bedbug infestation that Maier said was the result of buying what appeared to be a used box spring from the Stamford Sleepyâ€™s store.\\n\\nOne week after receiving the box spring, Maier said in a telephone interview, his wife began developing red spots, which Maier said came from bedbugs.\\n\\nHe said they hired the Stern Environmental Group of Secaucus, N.J. to investigate and to exterminate the bugs. The company â€“ which specializes in ridding homes of bedbugs – dismantled the box spring and determined that it was the cause of the infestation, Maier said.\\n\\nStern Environmental Groupâ€™s report, made available to me, states that the â€œbox spring … was the culprit. There were bedbugs inside and the box spring did not look like it was new.â€\\x9d\\n\\nMaier said it took two months before all the bedbugs could be killed. (During that time, he told me, he and his wife had to stay in their bed because if they slept somewhere else the bedbugs would have moved with them.)\\n\\nHe said Sleepyâ€™s attorneys offered a replacement box spring, but they denied that the bedbugs came from their merchandise.\\n\\nMaier said he was suspicious when the delivery was made because the heavy plastic used to seal the box spring appeared to have been opened. He said one of the workers assured him that it was opened by them as they took it out of their truck.\\n\\nMaier said there is no other explanation for the bedbug infestation. The couple had not slept anywhere else in the weeks prior to their purchase, Maier said, and their personal habits had not changed.\\n\\nAdam S. Blank, Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer, said last month Sleepyâ€™s was unaware of Blumenthalâ€™s investigation and said bedbugs do not originate in beds, but come from people.\\n\\nIf Sleepyâ€™s had delivered a box spring to Maier that contained bedbugs, all the other merchandise on the truck would have also had bedbugs, he wrote in a five-page response to my questions.\\n\\nâ€œSleepyâ€™s does not now, has never, and will never, sell a used mattress. Any claim to the contrary we find to be defamatory,â€\\x9d wrote Blank.\\n\\nThe BBB report state that in the past three years, 633 complaints were filed against Sleepyâ€™s 700 stores (no state-by-state breakdown available).\\n\\nBBB statistics show that complaints grew yearly in the following areas: warranty issues, product issues, refund or exchange issues, selling practices and delivery issues.\\n\\nâ€œComplaints to the BBB have alleged failure to provide timely delivery; failure to honor warranties and guarantees; credit and billing disputes; and poor product quality. This firm has failed to eliminate the underlying cause of complaints brought to its attention by the Bureau,â€\\x9d the bureau reports on its web site.\\n\\nBetter Bedding, with nine stores in Connecticut and now in reorganization in Bankruptcy Court, has had four complaints with the BBB in the past three years and still has its top rating of A+.\\n\\nIn 2002 Sleepyâ€™s paid a $4,000 fine to Connecticut consumer officials as part of a settlement into complaints the company delivered mattresses in the middle of night and delivered defective merchandise, and a complaint that used merchandise may have been sold as new. In all four cases, Sleepyâ€™s did not admit to any wrongdoing, which is common in out-of-court settlements.\\n\\nThe report from Stern, Sleepyâ€™s complete response, the 2002 Connecticut settlement details, and the BBB reports, as well as details of the four settlements will be published on this blog.\\n\\nSimilar Posts:',\n",

       " 'Tag Archives: Batman & Robin\\n\\nFollowing the piracy of \"Batman\" #17 in advance of its release date earlier this week, DC Comics has another leak on its hands. A photo of variant covers for \"Batman, Incorporated\" #8 has surfaced, nearly two weeks prior to the comic\\'s February 27 release date. The photo shows three variant covers homaging Grant Morrison\\'s \"Batman: R.I.P.,\" with Damian Wayne\\'s Robin standing in for his father, the Dark Knight. Additionally, the letters \"R.I.P.\" appear at the bottom, using Robin\\'s \"R\" icon, revealing a major spoiler for Morrison\\'s upcoming \"Batman, Incorporated\" arc, which has been kept under tight wraps by DC. Damian\\'s death as the focus of Morrison\\'s newest arc has been a popular theory on Internet message boards, as Damian is nowhere to be found on the covers for May\\'s Batman-related issues, even on the cover of \"Batman and Robin\" #19.\\n\\nWhen approached by CBR News about the leak, DC representatives replied, \"No comment.\"\\n\\n\"Batman Incorporated\" #8 is far enough from its release date that retailers shouldn\\'t have received copies from Diamond yet. Retailers who opt-in to Diamond\\'s early delivery typically receive issues on the Tuesday before release, which makes how Mega obtained the issues somewhat of a mystery. Timing-wise, the leak syncs with the \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #700 leak last year, when scans of the issue popped up online 12 days early, exactly the same amount of time before the issue was scheduled for release.\\n\\n\"It\\'s always disappointing when someone decides to spoil a big story by posting it on the torrents,\" Alonso told CBR. \"Piracy affects fans, creators and retailers who look forward to a big comic book to put some cash in their registers — which \\'Amazing Spider-Man #700\\' definitely will do.

Well if you picked up the issue when it hit stores this past Wednesday, you now know exactly what we were talking about!\\n\\nIn JUSTICE LEAGUE #14, the League continues their battle against the Cheetah and Superman, while simultaneously trying to protect the Man of Steel from the wounds inflicted upon him. Deep in the forest, they meet the tribe that the Cheetah was meant to protect. The head of this tribe details the long history of the Cheetah and reveals that the root of the problem is not that the Goddess of the Hunt is evil. Instead, it’s the woman possessed by her who is!\\n\\nAfter being captured by the tribe, Superman is cured, and Cheetah gets locked away in Belle Reve. But once behind bars, the villainess begins to talk to an unseen source, revealing that her imprisonment was all part of a larger and mysterious plan. Meanwhile, on the Watchtower, the League tells Diana that Barbara Minerva is a lie. She is actually a wanted criminal who continues to switch identities to escape the authorities. Hurt by this news about the woman she once called her best friend, Wonder Woman seeks comfort in the Man of Steel.\\n\\nMuch to the surprise of the local customers, Superman takes Wonder Woman to the Smallville Diner in an attempt to help her regain some incentive to be the superhero that she is. Afterwards, he takes her on a tour of the Kent family farm and the duo share another passionate kiss.\\n\\nLittle do these lovebirds know, someone is watching their every move! It’s their teammate, Batman. And judging by the look on his face, he seems less than thrilled about his friends’ developing romance. How will the Dark Knight’s knowledge of Wonder Woman and Superman’s relationship impact it? And more importantly, what will this mean for the Justice League itself? Place your bets in the comments section!\\n\\nBelow, take a look at the final pages of “The Secret of the Cheetah” as Superman and Wonder Woman kiss under the watchful eye of Batman.

An iconic Batman bad guy who has appeared in comics, film, TV, video games and pretty much any type of media featuring the Caped Crusader, \"Batman\" writer Scott Snyder finally takes his long-awaited shot at writing Gotham\\'s maniacal clown in a new October-launching story arc titled \"Death Of The Family.\"\\n\\nThe Joker debuted in 1940 in the pages of \"Batman\" #1, beginning his 70-odd year life as a criminal psychopath and one of Batman\\'s most dangerous archenemies. In the relaunched New 52 DC Universe, the Joker was first and last seen in writer/artist Tony Daniels\\' \"Detective Comics\" #1, getting a face lift from the villain the Dollmaker — quite literally, as Dollmaker peeled Joker\\'s entire face off and tacked it to the wall.\\n\\nMysteriously and noticably absent since that issue, Snyder\\'s \"Death Of The Family,\" drawn by regular \"Batman\" artist Greg Capullo, will be the first to touch on the character fully since last September as the Joker returns, gunning for Batman and all the Bat allies.\\n\\nAmidst all the buzz surrounding the recently announced storyline, CBR spoke directly with Snyder about his new story, how Joker will look sans-face, and the Joker crossover brewing among the rest of the Bat books.',\n",

       " 'For the sake of Vancouver Canucks fans’ sanity, let’s assume that the unfortunate result of Jesperi Kotkaniemi holding Elias Pettersson behind the play and falling awkwardly on his leg leads to a much more minor injury than it looked like initially, and Pettersson can get back into games before we know it.\\n\\nThe Canucks will need their rookie phenom to continue to be in top form if they have any hope of making the playoffs this year. At this stage of the season, I don’t think I was alone in thinking the Canucks would be much further out of the picture, but the team has rallied around the transcendent performance of Pettersson and sit just one point behind the Anaheim Ducks for the second wild card spot in the West.\\n\\nStream Canucks hockey on Sportsnet NOW Sportsnet NOW gives you access to over 500 NHL games this season, blackout-free, including Hockey Night in Canada, Rogers Hometown Hockey, Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey, the entire 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs and more.\\n\\nThe one wrench in the gears outside of Pettersson’s injury is that the Canucks have played more games than every other team they’re within four points of, and the team that’s the most dangerous to them in Minnesota has a whopping five games in hand.\\n\\nSo the question becomes how likely is it that Vancouver can squeeze its way into one of those wild card spots? Let’s look at how the Canucks compare to the teams that are within plus or minus four points of them the standings.\\n\\nExamining the statistics at 5-vs-5 on a team-wide perspective, things don’t look too great for the Canucks. They’re outplayed by their opponents in each of the major categories that lead to goal scoring. Specifically, the Canucks are weakest at manufacturing and preventing quality chances, both in terms of shot locations and puck movement.\\n\\nThe good news for the Canucks is that three of these teams can make the cut, and of this group they’re currently third in the tiebreaker (regulation or overtime wins with 19, tied with Minnesota). However, that’s about the only bit of good news.\\n\\nJacob Markstrom has had a strong season for a team that isn’t amazing defensively, but of this group, he’s only putting up a better save percentage than one team’s starting goalie — Edmonton’s Cam Talbot, who has been giving up more and more of the net to Mikko Koskinen. Koskinen has also been stronger than Markstrom so far.\\n\\nTop prospect Thatcher Demko could add depth in goal for the Canucks, giving them more chances to win games that may have previously felt like schedule losses. Even if they start getting better goaltending, their play at 5-vs-5 has to improve if they’re going to not only pass one of the teams ahead of them, but avoid being leapfrogged by Minnesota as the season wears on.\\n\\nOf the teams currently in a playoff spot, the Anaheim Ducks look to be the most vulnerable, despite the fact they’re getting fewer than 40 per cent of the high danger chances in their games. They have John Gibson stopping 92.5 per cent of the shots he faces papering over their weaknesses.\\n\\nDallas is the other team that looks a little vulnerable, and much like the Ducks they’re being carried by great goaltending, with Ben Bishop stopping 92.3 per cent of everything he’s seen this season.\\n\\n31 Thoughts: The Podcast Jeff Marek and Elliotte Friedman talk to a lot of people around the hockey world, and then they tell listeners all about what they’ve heard and what they think about it.\\n\\nLooking at special teams doesn’t exactly bode well for the Canucks either, as they’re among the bottom-10 teams in the league at creating scoring chances on the power play. They also shoot from outside the slot more than league average.\\n\\nVancouver does have a very effective penalty kill, preventing scoring chances overall like a top-10 team, while limiting high danger chances like a top-five team. That’s something to build on, but hockey goes both ways; you have to prevent goals and score them.\\n\\nThe Pettersson effect has been enough to get them this far, but getting over the hump and into the playoffs is a bigger challenge than simply being almost there. Both the standings and the statistics are stacked against them this season, and while playoff fever may be a tempting feeling for Vancouver to capture once again, I don’t think it would be a bad thing necessarily for this group to just miss out on the postseason.\\n\\nRemember that in September this team was expected to be among the worst in the league. Now, all these young players have realized the team is better initially projected and can play well enough to get close to the playoffs. That lesson, along with a better draft pick, is not such a bad consolation prize if the Canucks can’t pull it off.\\n\\nThis is clearly a team on the rise, but they don’t look like they’re quite at playoff level yet.',\n",

       " 'Post navigation\\n\\nAn Interview With The Bollocks (Kenny Williams)\\n\\nI’m a fan of simple titles for things. The words will do the talking know what I mean? Flashy titles tends to mean pish writing if ye ask me. So with the interviews its always just “An Interview With *insert name*” and thats that. Had tae make a slight exception here because this is an interview with Kenny Williams, and Kenny is the fuckin bollocks. No question. Kenny is one of the fastest rising stars in Scottish Wrestling, and a fan favourite everywhere he goes because he gets it. He knows what folk want from a wrestling show. They want entertainment. They want cunts knocking their pan in to provide that entertainment, and some of them even want the guys providing said entertainment to have more product in their hair than a burd in a beauty pageant. Kenny Williams has it all. When he first debuted alongside Christopher in ICW, my first thought was “aww whit, ANOTHER one of these wee fannies?” but we soon seen Kenny was nae joke. Him and Christopher’s match with the NAK at ICWs Maryhill show was when most of us realised Kenny was legit. Kenny is the bollocks.\\n\\nThe bollocks took some time out of his busy schedule of being a globetrotting professional sha….I mean wrestler, to answer a few questions for his pals at Snapmare Necks (thats us btw) so you should probably go right ahead and read that shit. Its waiting for ye. Down there. See it? Just below this? Thats the one. In amongst it.\\n\\n1. You’re one of the newer faces in Scottish Wrestling, can you tell us a bit about how you got started and who/what influenced your decision to give wrestling a go?\\n\\nGenerally I’ve always loved the ‘Rasslin! But it wasn’t untill I was about 18 that I decided to give it a go. I had gotten into Law at university straight from school but I only last about 6 weeks as I realised it just wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. I fannyed about for a few months after that and at the beginning of 2012 I decided to give something that I had always loved a bash. I searched about for local schools and luckily a PBW Academy had just opened in the area that I love of Airdrie. I’ve been hooked ever since then!\\n\\n2. The “Kenny is the bollocks” chant at ICW has been going for a while, with your popularity in the company seemingly sky high. How much do you enjoy working in front of those wild crowds, particularly when they seem to have taken you to their hearts so quickly?\\n\\nI find it ridiculous anytime that chant starts up when I come out. It’s so humbling and overwhelming and I appreciate who ever started it because I’m hopefully going to sell lots of t-shirts with that printed on it! Working for ICW is a tremendous experience and I’ve been so lucky with the situations that have arisen for me. Being part of Team CK the fans never really got to see the full potential that we had as a duo and so when Christopher decided to call it a day I was disheartened by it all. However, when I finally got a chance to showcase what I could do in the ring on a singles level, with one of the best in the country, Lionheart, that’s when it felt like everything clicked with the fans. They didn’t just see some wee guy with a quiff and pair of skinny jeans. They saw a wee guy with a quiff and skinny jeans that had a bit of fight and determination in him. Since then I’ve been riding on a wave of momentum that the fans have created with this chant! And I’m so grateful to every person who starts that up when I walk out with those dafties in the Kennedy Administration!\\n\\n3. You’re part of a stable with a bit of everything at the moment with the “Kennedy Administration” in ICW, how much are you enjoying being involved in that? And with you not getting on particularly well with your stable mates, are there any plans in place to toe their baws any time soon?\\n\\nI’m finding it really fun because it’s a different dynamic than any of the other factions in ICW as it’s a heel group with a fan favourite trapped in it. And luckily/unluckily I’m that fan favourite so it’s funny to see how harshly the fans react to James R Kennedy when he starts hurling abuse at me. The fans anticipation for me to finally skud one of them is definitely growing but its like being caught between a rock and a hard place as I can’t risk having my contract terminated by Kennedy.\\n\\n4. You recently made your debut for SWA, in a belter of a match against Lewis Girvan, and you’re a regular with PBW. How do you enjoy the family friendly shows compared to the adult orientated ones?\\n\\nDespite the obvious differences in content of the shows, I feel that working any wrestling show the fans are all there for the same reason, to see top quality wrestling that Scotland has become a custom to. So I enjoy the two types equally because I’m getting to do what I love to do and if I’m doing it well I’m hopefully entertaining the fans who have made the effort to come out and support their local wrestling promotion.\\n\\n5. Do you have a match that you’d rank as your best so far?\\n\\nI’m to critical of myself to cite a best match so instead ill list some favourites and plug some of the youtube footage I have\\nPBW- vs Zack Sabre Jr.. A match that came out of pure circumstance and I was a last-minute substitute. Working Zack was a ridiculous experience as he is just a different class of performer.\\n\\nPBW – Kenny Williams vs Zack Sabre Jr\\n\\nPBW – vs Liam Thompson… Got to main event in my hometown and fool friends and family into thinking I had won the title. Was a crazy atmosphere and by far one of my favourite nights in wrestling\\n\\nPBW – Liam Thomson vs Kenny Williams (PBW Title Match)\\n\\nICW – vs Lionheart… Like I said this match really helped establish me as a singles competitor and a fan favourite and it took a lot of folk by surprise.\\nBCW – vs Kid Fite… Got to main event a show with a guy who was a major part of my training so it meant a lot to me. Also happened to be a year after I debuted so it was full of sentimentalities!\\n\\n(Not the match Kenny mentioned, as its been taken off youtube, but still a cracker of a match between these two)\\n\\nSSW – Kid Fite vs Kenny Williams\\n\\n6. Favourite wrestler? Either currently or all-time…or both if ye fancy.\\n\\nCurrently my favourite wrestler would have to be Bray Wyatt. He’s so captivating, it’s like watching a scene from a movie when he cuts a promo and his matches are always so different from what’s going on in the rest of the show. Of all time it has to be Shawn Michaels. I got into wrestling when he came back all born again and drug free so I got HBK when he was at his healthiest and churning out some of his best matches.\\n\\n7. You’re confirmed for ICWs latest project, a show mainly geared towards the younger talents called “Spacebaws – A New Hope”. Are you excited to play a prominent role on this show?\\n\\nI have no idea what I’ll be doing on this show I have to admit. I’m on the poster so I’m on the show! I can assure you though this will be a night not to miss! Cramming a show full of hungry young talent in an over 18s environment is a recipe for mayhem because there will be a level of one up manship between every person on that show to prove to Mark Dallas why they deserve to be part of ICW’s regular roster. I’ll be doing the exact same to prove why I deserve to be at the level I’ve been fortunate enough to get to so quickly so I’d advise folk to get a ticket before they disappear!\\n\\n8. Earliest wrestling memory?\\n\\nWaking up early on a Saturday to watch Smackdown on Sky 1 and asking my cousin to VHS record any PPV he would end up paying for. Think the first one I can remember watching back with him was Wrestlemania 17.\\n\\n9. You recently worked on the PBW Academy Attacks show in Coatbridge, where many PBW Academy students made their debuts. Are there any in particular that standout in your opinion?\\n\\nThe PBW Academy is amongst the top wrestling schools in Britain. It has 3 branches (Airdrie/Barrhead/Greenock) and has churned out some of the best young talent on the scene just now such as Noam Dar, Andy Wild, Kay Lee Ray, Davey Blaze, TJ Rage, Saqib Ali and more. To say I picked a great school to learn is an understatement. The talent coming through just now including myself have had a lot of opportunities to showcase there talents and the academy attack shows are definitely one of the chance to shine in front of a crowd and also in front of certain promoters. It has opened doors for a lot of younger guys who have stood out such as Lou King Sharp, Brendan Cooper, Tommy Marx, Aaron Echo and more. Lou King Sharp in particular has started to make a name for himself debuting on the first Academy Attack show against myself and in the last year he has went on to wrestle for Pro Wrestling Elite, British Championship Wrestling and is also confirmed for ICW Space Baws. He is so unique with his character work and I’m pleased he is getting the opportunities he is getting.\\n\\n10. You made your PCW debut recently, how was the PCW experience and has this led to further opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland?\\n\\nWorking for PCW was a cool experience. I was given a shot in there annual Rumble and managed to last about 15 minutes which wasn’t so bad for the skinniest guy in the match. I’d love to work there again but in less crowded match so I could really show the fans down there exactly what I can bring to the table. Other opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland have come up recently with my debut in May for Kamikaze Pro which is a great promotion down in Birmingham. I’m also set to debut in Ireland at the end of the year. Also luckily for me I’ve had the chance to wrestle outside of Scotland through ICW who have ran successful shows in both London and Newcastle.\\n\\nI’ve been really fortunate so far with the opportunities I’ve had in wrestling and I’m so grateful to both TJ Rage and Kid Fite for their high level of training and to all the promoters who have ever put my on a show. I’m having a rare time with the wrestling and I’m lucky to be a part of some of the top promotions in the country.\\n\\nCheers to Kenny for taking the time to answer the questions, and it goes without saying, but get yerselves to all of these shows, and any other show Kenny might be on, and any other show with wrestling on it, cause wrestling is the fuckin best shit on the planet that disnae involve breasts, and sometimes it even involves breasts!',\n",

       " 'Monday, April 5, 2010\\n\\nInspiration From Behind\\n\\nToday I was driving home from work and noticed a truck in front of me, one lane over. It was actually the truck\\'s camper I noticed, truth be told, which looked like Paul Bunyan\\'s playpen if he went to a daycare that wasn\\'t up to code. The wooden slats were covered in bumper stickers of varying colors and sizes. What I have to assume was a strategic move to ensure maximum readership, the best sticker of the bunch was placed in the top right-hand corner (which we all know from Google analysis is the most effective spot).\\n\\nIt said, \"Don\\'t be a dick.\"\\n\\nYeah, I thought. I\\'m with you, buddy. Now, this was a sentiment I support. It wasn\\'t political (there was no Dick Cheney photo), it wasn\\'t a band (like Citizen Dick) and it didn\\'t have a web site promoted underneath. I took it as a proverb of sorts, probably more colorful than Jesus would like, but with the same kind of heart.\\n\\nI started to look for an image of this particular bumper sticker online so I could post it here, but after three unsuccessful tries I started to get a gnawing feeling in my stomach. This is my work laptop I\\'m writing on, and I really don\\'t want to have to explain to someone why I kept typing \"dick\" into a search engine after hours. Who\\'s with me here?\\n\\nWhat stuck with me most is there\\'s got to be a story behind this. Most people post a sticker that announces their political persuasion, their vanity about their kids\\' grades, their desire to pee on a [insert your brand here] vehicle, or what their stick figure family would look like. I don\\'t often see a sticker with a good lesson for us all on the back of a truck camper. (Although I did find it polite that one was open about the fact that he does brake for hookers; it\\'s always good to know when a large vehicle is coming to a stop. Thanks for the heads up!) So I\\'m thinking either the guy driving had such a bad experience, SUCH a dick in his life that he felt personally responsible from preventing it from happening to someone else...or he is fully aware he is a horrible driver, plans to continue driving badly, and is warning you upfront not to succumb to road rage. The more I thought about it, the less warm fuzzy I felt and the more worried I became.Are you about to litter? I wondered. What, am I not supposed to get mad if you throw your trash out the window, only to have it bounce off my windshield? Or if you keep encountering dick after dick, shouldn\\'t you do a little self-examination? Maybe it\\'s YOU, not them.\\n\\nWith a sticker like that, a cop is bound to notice. So what, are you anti-police or something? Anti-government? Are you one of those crazies who lives on a compound somewhere? Don\\'t get in my lane.\\n\\nAnd really, by telling me not to \"be\" a dick, aren\\'t you kind of saying I could be already, that you see that quality in me, even though all I\\'m doing is driving behind you, innocently, listening to my Owl City album on my iPod? That\\'s pretty rude, man. Jeez. Why don\\'t you take your own advice already and leave me the hell alone?',\n",

       " 'When 24-year-old Morris Beckman returned to his house on Amhurst Road in Hackney, he’d experienced quite a lot. His time fighting fascism abroad had seen him survive two Nazi torpedo attacks on a British Navy ship in the Atlantic. While his relieved mother showered him with affection on his return home, his father’s message was rather starker: ‘The bastards are back,’ he warned. Indeed, the London that Beckman returned to fell far short of the expectations of himself and millions of other ex-servicemen. Though it may run counter to the popular narrative of the triumph over Hitler, fascism grew rapidly in Britain immediately following the Second World War. Fascist prisoners interned during the war began to reorganise their crippled movement, while a new presence of captured Nazi soldiers being released from prisoner-of-war camps and into British society prompted a far-right renaissance. Within months of the war’s end, fourteen fascist groups and at least three bookshops operated openly across the city. Newspapers with names like Britain Awake and The Patriot were readily available on street corners. Most alarmingly of all, fascists began staging outdoor rallies in the densely-Jewish East End once again. ‘Openly in the streets you had public meetings shouting out the same antagonism and the same filth as before the war,’ commando veteran Jules Konopinski recalled, ‘and now even worse – they were saying the gas chambers weren’t enough.’ Alarm spread among the Jewish community that anti-Semitism could find a foothold so soon after the defeat of the Nazis.\\n\\nEmergence Nowhere was alarm at the situation felt more strongly than in Maccabi House, a Jewish sports club in Hampstead. Morris Beckman recalled that the club had a ‘subdued ambience’ that reflected the ‘weariness and uncertainties’ of the times. Polish-Jewish veterans of the Allied forces with no families or homes to return to were forging friendships in a new city. Several pre-war Maccabi regulars died fighting Hitler. The ones that had survived, once awash with optimism, were now world-weary veterans who mixed uncomfortably with jovial teenagers who hadn’t served. In those days the true enormity of the Holocaust wasn’t known, and as the full picture began to emerge it had a profound effect on the community. Jewish ex-servicemen in particular carried a ‘sick sense of shame’, Beckman said, that no Allied action had been taken to prevent Nazi operations in the death camps. This consciousness was emerging at the same time as walls in London — whose Jewish community had only escaped the fate of their European neighbours by geographical quirk — were once again being daubed with swastikas. To many, it felt as if Britain hadn’t learnt a thing. The Truth, a magazine whose editor, Colin Brooks, was a close confidante of Daily Mail owner Lord Rothermere, called for Jews to give up their houses to ‘British’ ex-servicemen. In October 1945, thousands signed an ‘anti-alien’ petition in Hampstead which called to expel the area’s large Jewish refugee population. In February 1946, while driving for a pint in Hampstead Heath, four young Jewish ex-servicemen — the former Hurricane ace Alec Carson, Gerry Flamberg, Len Sherman, and Morris Beckman — witnessed a rally by the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, the organisation of Jeffrey Hamm. A familiar face of pre-war fascism, Hamm was interned for his loyalty to Hitler and was now seeking to rebuild Oswald Mosley’s movement. Addressing a sixty-strong meeting, Hamm chose his words carefully, denouncing the ‘aliens in our midst’ who ‘waxed fat in the black market’ while British soldiers died. Pretending to buy a copy of Britain Awake, Sherman abruptly knocked two fascists unconscious by banging their heads together. Flamberg toppled the makeshift stage and knocked Hamm over. As the crowd scattered, an elderly German Jew stayed to shake their hands. It occurred to all four that they could face serious charges for their actions. ‘Well then,’ Carson said, ‘it’s about time they change the laws.’ Their action was widely supported, and an organising meeting at Maccabi House was arranged to push back the fascist threat. Thirty-eight ex-servicemen and five women turned up. The vast majority were Jewish, but the group also included non-Jewish socialists like Joe Zilliacus, a former Marine and son of left-wing Labour MP Konni Zilliacus. What united them was their conviction that the Jewish community must not be passive in the face of provocations. Alec Black, a veteran of the D-Day landings, proposed establishing an organisation that could effectively fight fascism and anti-Semitism. He knew this would be a serious endeavour and emphasised that everyone involved would risk serious harm and jail time. Anyone feeling nervous about this activity could leave without any judgement or prejudice against them. No one moved an inch or said a word. The organisation had two aims: to prevent fascist activities by physical force if necessary, and to pressure Parliament into making racial incitement a criminal offence. Since those present had few motivations beyond completing the tasks at hand, no grandiose names were suggested. It was decided they would be called ‘The 43 Group’, after the number of people in the room. But, by April of that year, the name seemed misplaced; over 300 people had bolstered the Group’s ranks.\\n\\nConfrontation After encountering their first post-war instances of physical resistance, London’s fascists dropped their respectable veneer. Rather than hiding behind dog-whistle phrases, the seasoned repertoire of Hitler salutes, ‘Heil Mosley’ chants, and renditions of the Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, returned. In the face of constant physical attacks in their communities and workplaces, fascist anger grew increasingly frenzied. A bomb was pushed through the door of Gerry Flamberg’s home, while two 43 Group commandos beat unconscious a young fascist who had stitched razorblades into a flat cap and charged through Stamford Hill slashing people’s faces. In November 1946, 43 Group militants published a letter in the Jewish Chronicle appealing for further assistance. It inspired a swell in members, but provoked an angry response from Louis Hydelman, who sat on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Accusing the young commandos of acting ‘counterproductively’, Hydelman ordered the Group to disband. His intervention only highlighted the divide between young Jews committed to tackling the fascist presence and the older communal leadership, who remained legalistic in outlook. Hydelman’s letter, derided for its patronising tone, fell on deaf ears. The Group’s impressive infrastructure, convinced members they could afford to ignore their critics. Not only could they boast of an active base of 1,000 members, but they had also made influential friends. Left-wing Labour MPs such as D. N. Pritt, John Platt-Mills, and Woodrow Wyatt were keen supporters, while entertainment giants Jack Solomon and Bud Flanagan regularly donated significant sums to the organisation. On the streets, confrontations intensified. Tightly-organised 43 Group units would form human ‘wedges’ at rallies, pushing through fascist security to attack the stage, and use ‘supporting parties’ to heckle and break up fascist proceedings. On Sunday, 1 June 1947, these skirmishes came to a head in Ridley Road, a market area of Hackney known for its vibrant Jewish life. The fascists’ decision to demonstrate here was particularly provocative as it had been a favoured site of Mosley’s British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The 43 Group organised for the ‘Battle for Ridley Road’ with military precision. Commandos were given maps of the surrounding streets with entry and exit points for ambush attacks. But walking up to the platform they were still taken back by the size of the far-right crowd. With police backing too, the fascists hugely outnumbered the 43 Group. But they nonetheless infiltrated the audience in front of the stage and, when fascist leader Alexander Raven Thomson began to speak, started heckling. ‘Going back to the Isle of Man for your holidays?’ one commando shouted. (Thomson had been imprisoned in a detention camp on the Isle of Man during the war.) ‘They should have hanged you with William Joyce!’ said another. Then the wedge struck and ferocious fighting broke out. A description of scenes by Morris Beckman recalls the intensity. A young fascist about eighteen years of age appeared in front of me and called me a ‘Fucking Jew bastard’, catching my left thigh with a nearly well-aimed kick. I hit his nose square on and it spurted blood … I kicked his backside as hard as I could and he staggered off. A hard blow landed smack on my right ear and completely unbalanced me. For a moment, I was dazed, disorientated. My assailant was about to close and finish me off when Sam grabbed him around the neck and pulled him to the ground. Then Sam jumped on him. The genial, good-humoured Sam said, ‘I’m just breaking the bastard’s ribs so he won’t attend any more meetings.’',\n",

Oral antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the incidence of bacterial infections. The administration of oral antibiotics, however, may be difficult in some cirrhotic patients with active bleeding. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding. From December 1998 to September 2001, a total of 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh class B or C were enrolled after emergent endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) was taken because of esophageal variceal bleeding. Enrolled patients were randomized into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group (n=20) received the intravenous ciprofloxacin 200mg IV q 12 hours for 3 days while the control group(n=20) didn,t. Bacterial infection developed in nine patients (45%) of the control group and only two patients (10%) in the treatment group. The incidence of bacterial infections was significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group (p < 0.005). The hospital cost and length of hospital stay decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in the hospital course and mortality within 30 days between the two groups. In cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding and with Child-Pugh class B or C, the use of intravenous ciprofloxacin for 3 days after EVL was not only effective in the prevention of bacterial infections but also cost-effective.',\n",

He begins talking about how kickass Morgan Freeman is and how he becomes every character he plays. Shoutouts to Spencer Tracy, Laurence Olivier, and others. Morgan Freeman looks like he’s about to cry. Poitier says Freeman is a prince in the profession he has chosen. Helen Mirren comes out and says she’s had a couple glasses of wine, but she has a bone to pick with Morgan Freeman because she’s only been in one film with him. It goes on a bit long, but it’s Helen Mirren so we’re okay with it. And here comes the retrospective of films. Damn, this man has been in some amazing movies over time.\\n\\n9:00 Best part of that retrospective: the clip from Electric Company where he’s bathing in a casket. And according to IMDB, his first role was as an uncredited man on the street in The Pawnbroker in 1964.\\n\\n9:03 Morgan Freeman comes up and says he absolutely loves Helen Mirren. He said that after working with her on Red and watching her handle a gun, he knows he never wants to piss her off. He also says he will call his award the Sidney Poitier Award. He talks about how he got to make movies with people he admires and that he’s had so much fun. Then he randomly says hey to Elton John. Oh, Morgan Freeman. You’re so fantastic.\\n\\n9:07 Fun fact: Morgan Freeman’s first credited role was in a 1971 film called “Who Says You Can’t Ride a Rainbow.” He played a character named Afro.\\n\\n9:10 Robert Downey, Jr. comes out in a tux with tails. He introduces the preview of The Artist.\\n\\n9:12 Angelina Jolie comes out to introduce Best Director. Martin Scorsese wins for Hugo. Definitely thought it was going to be Michel Hazanavicius. Scorsese gives a shoutout to the HFPA for their work in film preservation. He gives a shoutout to his wife who gave him the book Hugo is based on and encouraged him to make a film his 12-year-old daughter could actually see. Ben Kingsley waves from the back. Scorsese leaves out Chloe Grace Moretz, which makes me sad.\\n\\n9:15 Ricky Gervais is back with another glass of wine. He introduces Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas. They bleep Ricky Gervais and then Antonio Banderas starts yelling in Spanish. If he’s saying something bad, the censors don’t know it. They go on to give Best TV Comedy to Modern Family. The kids all run up from the back. Sofia Vergara starts yelling in Spanish. She’s either really silly or she is absolutely smashed right now. Best acceptance speech ever. Sofia Vergara gives the actual acceptance speech in Spanish and Steven Levitan (I think) translates it, but turns it into a speech about how the writers are the best lovers Sofia has had and all film actresses need to give them their numbers. Freaking awesome.\\n\\n9:23 Michelle Pfeiffer comes out. Her face does not look real anymore. She goes on to show the preview for War Horse.\\n\\n9:24 What is Jessica Biel wearing and why does she have three boobs all of a sudden? Her and Mark Wahlberg present Best Actor in a Movie – Comedy/Musical to Jean Dujardin for The Artist. Dujardin mentions that he is French, too. Nice callback to Ludovic Bource’s speech earlier. Dujardin tells how he was told that he would never do movies because his face is too expressive. Apparently, his eyebrows think independently. That man is freaking adorable.\\n\\n9:31 Queen Latifah (from “Joyful Noise,” which she has to pretend is a good movie right now) comes out to introduce The Help.\\n\\n9:33 Ricky Gervais has ditched his ugly jacket. He introduces Colin Firth and acts super jealous of him. According to Gervais, Colin Firth is super racist and has punched a blind kitten. Firth makes a dig back at Gervais and goes on to introduce the nominees for Best Actress – Drama. Meryl Streep wins for The Iron Lady. Everyone gives her a standing ovation. She acts like she’s surprised to win and says she only got to play Margaret Thatcher after Ricky Gervais’s deal fell through. They bleep Meryl Streep. Pretty sure that’s not allowed. Someone is passing her glasses up from the back. And Meryl is just naming off random actresses now. Meryl just called Harvey Weinstein God. She’ll probably get some crap for that tomorrow. They start to play her off, but she says no and they stop for a second. That’s how famous Meryl Streep is, y’all.\\n\\n9:39 Jane Fonda comes out to present Best Movie – Comedy/Musical. In a move that surprises absolutely no one, The Artist wins. Even the dog is there! People get distracted from the producer’s speech by the dog’s adorableness. Also, Jean Dujardin’s wife is totally recording the entire ceremony on her cameraphone. So adorbs. The dog is totally begging for a treat. So cute. Another producer tries to say something, but they are actually pulling the mic back into the stage. Damn.\\n\\n9:47 Ricky Gervais introduces Natalie Portman and talks about putting her family first this year led her to not be nominated for anything. She presents Best Actor in a Drama to George Clooney for The Descendants. Where the fuck is Ryan Gosling? Why isn’t he there? I want to see his beautiful, feminist-loving face and body in a tux tonight. George Clooney is his standard, adorable self.\\n\\n9:54 Harrison Ford comes out to present Best Picture – Drama. They barely even show his face before they start showing the nominees. The Descendants wins. One of the producers comes up and says they’ve been told to hurry, so they rush through the acceptance speech as much as possible. Alexander Payne starts talking. Play-off music starts up.\\n\\n9:57 Ricky Gervais comes back to close out the show. Perfect summary of the evening, “I hope you’ve enjoyed your goodie bags, the champagne, the gold. I hope it took your mind off the recession.” They end with a close-up of the crystal chandelier. Nice.\\n\\n9:59 Final score. 15 for 25. Was hoping for closer to 70 or 75%, but at least I finished above 50%. Hope y’all haven’t been too bored by my ramblings. See ya for the Oscars.',\n",

In stark\\ncontrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of\\nobesity compared to gay males.”Apparently,\\n“these disparities are of high public-health significance,” therefore,\\nthe National Institutes of Health has been continuously funding the project.\\nSince CNSNews.com first discovered\\nthe government’s funding of the study in 2013, the cost to taxpayers\\nhas increased from approximately $1.5 million to over $3.5 million.\\nA website with information pertaining to the project claims the study will continue until June 30, 2016.Source\\n\\nNow you know what your funding with your hard earned money.\\nNubian Queen.\",\n",

       " 'AES and Marketer FAQs\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nWhat is Electric Choice?\\nElectric Choice is a statewide initiative giving all customers the option to choose the company that supplies their electricity. Residential and Business customers can elect to remain a customer of a regulated utility, such as DTE Electric, or enter into a contract with an Alternative Electric Supplier.\\n\\nElectric Choice, or restructuring, separates electric service into its three basic components: generation, transmission and distribution. When a customer elects to participate in Electric Choice, the cost of electric supply, generation and transmission, will be determined by a contract between the customer and the Alternative Electric Supplier.\\n\\nRegardless of who supplies the electricity, the regulated utility will continue to provide the distribution and metering services required to deliver power to the homes or businesses located within their service territory.\\n\\nAs an AES or a Marketer who is qualified to participate in DTE Electric Choice Program, who can I call at DTE Electric if I have questions?\\nAn AES or a Marketer should contact the Supplier Account Manager that DTE Electric has assigned to your company when they have inquires about the DTE Electric Choice Program.\\n\\nWhere can I get more information on Electric Choice in the state of Michigan?\\nVisit the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) website to find a directory of licensed Alternative Electric Suppliers and Marketers, MPSC’s Glossary of Electric Choice Terms, and to learn more about Electric Choice in Michigan.\\n\\nWhat are the DTE Electric rate classifications?\\nAll rates are contained in DTE Electric\\'s rate book, which can be viewed on the MPSC web site.\\n\\nQualifications\\n\\nWhat does a supplier need to do to qualify?\\nNavigate to the Supplier Tools section of this website to find the instructions on how to qualify as an AES or Marketer.\\n\\nWho do I call at DTE Electric if my company is interested in participating in DTE Electric Choice Program as an AES or Marketer?\\nYou can call the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center hotline toll-free at 888.830.2170, or in the Detroit area dial 313.235.3796 Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST.\\n\\nAgreements\\n\\nIf I am an Alternative Electric Supplier (AES) and a Marketer, do both AES and Marketer Agreements need to be executed?\\nYes, the AES and Marketer Agreements have different terms and conditions, both agreements must be executed if you elect to participate as both an AES and a Marketer in DTE Electric Choice Program.\\n\\nWhat is the duration of the AES and Marketer Agreements?\\nThe AES Agreement will remain in effect unless canceled pursuant to Section 15 of the agreement, or terminated without cause by either Party with 30 days prior written notice. DTE reserves the right to replace or amend the AES Agreement as appropriate to reflect changes required by regulatory agencies.\\n\\nThe Marketer Agreement will remain in effect unless canceled pursuant to Section 9 of the agreement, or terminated without cause by either Party with 30 days prior written notice. DTE reserves the right to replace or amend this Marketer Agreement as appropriate to reflect changes required by regulatory agencies.\\n\\nHow does an AES notify DTE Electric that their Marketer Relationship has changed?\\nAn AES has the right to declare the entity that will act as their Marketer for their enrolled customer accounts. When an AES switches to a new Marketer they must notify DTE Electric of the new Marketer selection. The effective date of service from the new Marketer and termination of the former Marketer will occur on the first day of the calendar month following the completion of the following new Marketer participation requirements:\\n\\nAn AES must notify DTE Electric at least 30 days prior to the effective date of service from the new Marketer and termination of the former Marketer by submitting a new Alternative Electric Supplier-Marketer Notice form located in “AES Declaring a Switch of Marketer Relationship” section of the Supplier Tool Box.\\n\\nThe new entity you selected as your company’s Marketer must register for the Marketer participant role. Please direct your Marketer to complete the steps in the “How to Qualify as a Marketer” section of the Supplier Tool Box.\\n\\nThe DTE Electric Supplier Account Manager assigned to your company will contact the established AES Daily Contact Representative to assist your company with the Switch of Marketer Relationship Process.\\n\\nWhat is the process for a Complete Billing AES to update their financial institution with DTE Electric?\\nWhen an AES who elected to participate in DTE Electric Choice Program with the Complete Billing Option changes financial institution the AES must provide DTE Electric the new banking information via the following process:\\n\\nThe DTE Electric Supplier Account Manager assigned to your company will contact the established AES Daily Contact Representative to assist your company with the process to declare the new financial institution.\\n\\nParticipant Relationships\\n\\nIf I am both the alternative electric supplier (AES) and the Marketer, do I need to execute the AES-Marketer Notice (identifying a relationship with myself)?\\nYes. Even though you are both the AES and marketer, you must sign the AES-Marketer Notice. The AES-Marketer Notice informs DTE Electric whom the AES will have as its Marketer.\\n\\nCan an AES have more than one Marketer?\\nYes. AESs will need to identify each marketer with whom they will conduct business in a separate AES-Marketer Notice submitted to DTE Electric. A separate CP Node designation is required for each AES-Marketer business relationship.\\n\\nObtaining Usage Information\\n\\nWho will be allowed to get customer information and the associated historical usage data?\\nThe customer has always had access to its historical usage information and will continue to have access under the Electric Choice Program. Anyone authorized by the customer can get customer historical usage information. A Customer Information Release form is used to facilitate this request. The Customer Information Release form can be found in the Supplier Tool Box section of this website.\\n\\nHow long does it take to get a customer\\'s 12-month bill history once we have faxed the request?\\nCustomer use information will be sent to the requestor within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request, barring unusual circumstances.\\n\\nHow will the AES get billing determinants to use in billing its customers for energy?\\nThe AES will get an XML 867 transaction set after the enrolled account is invoiced by DTE Electric.\\n\\nHow will the AES know if the XML enrollments are received?\\nThe AES will receive an XML 814 confirmation transaction indicating a successful enrollment. For rejected enrollments, the XML 814 provides the reasons for rejection.\\n\\nHow will the AES and Marketer know when the customer is ready for electric choice service?\\nBoth the AES and Marketer will receive an XML 814 transaction set indicating that the customer is Site Ready, which means all validation checks have been completed and all metering requirements are in place.\\n\\nHow does an AES or an Aggregator request Peak Load Contribution (PLC) values?\\nAn AES or an Aggregator should submit a completed Customer Information Release Form to the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center to request PLC values.\\n\\nWho does an AES or an Aggregator contact regarding Peak Load Contribution (PLC) calculations?\\nAn AES should contact the Supplier Account Manager that DTE Electric has assigned to your company when they have inquires about PLC calculations.\\nAn Aggregator should contact the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center at 1.888.830.2170 from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST Monday through Friday or email them at suppliers@dteenergy.com\\n\\nBilling In-Service Electric Choice Accounts\\n\\nHow will customer billing be handled?\\nThe Alternative Electric Supplier (AES) has the option to have DTE Electric bill on its behalf, which is referred to as Complete Billing, or to bill its customers directly, which is referred to as Separate Billing. If the AES elects the Complete Billing option, the customer will receive one bill statement. The AES energy supply charges are separated from DTE Electric delivery charges to allow the customer to review each individual charge separately. If the AES chooses the Separate Billing option, the customer will receive two separate bills: one bill from the AES for energy supply charges and one bill from DTE Electric for delivery charges.\\n\\nWill there be a charge to switch to an Alternative Electric Supplier?\\nA $5.00 fee will be charged each time a customer switches to a different energy supplier. The switch fee applies when a customer switches from DTE Electric to an Alternative Electric Supplier (AES), from one AES to another AES, or from an AES back to DTE Electric.\\n\\nMeter Data\\n\\nFor those customers who elect to use the DTE Electric load profiling methodology, is there a cost associated with this service?\\nNo, there is no cost for the load profiling service.\\n\\nIf a separate data recording module is required for Marketers to obtain real-time data from a customer\\'s existing meter, is it DTE Electric\\'s intention to hold the Marketer responsible for the installation and maintenance of this equipment?\\nYes. The customer, AES or Marketer can install their own recorder using the pulses supplied at the meter installation. If they choose to have DTE Electric install the recorder, DTE Electric will charge the Marketer or customer for the installation and maintenance of DTE Electric approved separate data recording modules.\\n\\nWhat is your estimate of the cost of a data-recording module?\\nThe meter data-recording module is available for the customer at a cost of $8 per month. This request can be made by completing the Customer Information Release Form. For more information, please contact the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center at 1.888.830.2170 Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST.\\n\\nWho can I contact to ask questions about Load Profiling?\\nAES and Marketers should contact the Supplier Account Manager that DTE Electric has assigned to your company when they have inquiries regarding Load Profiling.\\n\\nEnrollment Process\\n\\nWhat is the Electric Choice “minimum term” for Business Customers?\\nThe minimum term for business customers is two years.\\n\\nWhat is the Electric Choice “minimum term”?\\nThe minimum term for Electric Choice Residential Electric Service is one full billing cycle.\\n\\nWhat is “slamming”?\\nSlamming is the unauthorized switching of a customer’s energy supply without their permission.\\n\\nHow will slamming be controlled?\\nThe DTE Electric Choice Program’s customer enrollment process incorporates a confirmation process to help reduce the likelihood of slamming. The electric restructuring legislation enacted in June 2000 made slamming illegal. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has established penalties for companies that engage in this practice. For more information, visit the MPSC website and search for MPSC Case Number U-12640.\\n\\nWhen the customer is enrolled and has been notified, can the customer dispute the enrollment?\\nIf the customer disputes their enrollment at any time, we will take the word of the customer, stop the enrollment process and notify the respective AES that the customer requested a cancellation.\\n\\nIf a customer is already enrolled with an AES and a second AES tries to enroll the same customer, what happens?\\nIf the customer\\'s first enrollment is still pending, the new enrollment will be rejected. However, if the customer is in service as an Electric Choice customer, the new enrollment will be treated as a switch request and all parties will be notified.\\n\\nWhere can I find DTE Electric’s current Electric Choice participation level numbers and available energy allotments for the DTE Electric Choice Program?\\nThe Cap Tracking System is a web-based tracker that displays the Cap level of the DTE Electric Choice Program. Click on Cap Tracking System on the menu bar to view the current Electric Choice participation level and available energy allotments of the DTE Electric Choice Program. Also DTE Electric reports its monthly and year-to-date retail sales summaries in the Appendix to the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) 45-Day Report.\\n\\nIf the regulated electric utility’s 10 percent cap is fully subscribed, what happens to new enrollments that I submit?\\nUnder state law, no more than 10 percent of a regulated electric utility’s average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year may take service from an Alternative Electric Supplier at any time. If the regulated electric utility’s 10 percent cap is fully subscribed, new enrollments will be placed in a Cap queue, per the procedures established in Case No. U-15801. For more information regarding Case No. U-15801 and the Electric Choice 10% Cap, please see the Customer Choice tab under Electricity on the MPSC website.\\n\\nWhat happens if an enrolled account either moves or asks for a read out or read in?\\nIf a customer notifies us of a move and requests a disconnect, we will initiate the \"Drop\" functionality in the system, which in turn notifies the AES and marketer of record of this \"Drop.\" The meter read data will be obtained and forwarded as part of an 867 XML transaction set.\\n\\nHow is the name or other customer information shared between the AES and DTE Electric as the distribution company?\\nDTE Electric releases customer information used to establish an AES relationship when we receive the properly executed Customer Information Release form submitted on behalf of the customer and signed by both the customer and the AES. Information beyond usage information, such as payment history and credit, is not released unless the customer chooses to give this information to the AES.',\n",

       " 'Experts quickly connected the alleged shooter, a truck driver named Robert Bowers, with Gab’s anti-Semitism by reviewing his posts, which were publicly available but have since been removed from the site, which itself was shuttered for several days after the attack but is once again available. When the Southern Poverty Law Center analyzed Bowers’s posts, it identified central themes that included “white genocide” and “globalism” — a buzzword often referring to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. Similar analyses of his posts presented equivalent conclusions.\\n\\nWe have a unique set of data that includes not just all of Bowers’s Gab posts but also all Gab posts since the site launched in 2016. The daily use of Gab is climbing. When the Pittsburgh shooting occurred, we recognized that our data could tell us more about both the accused shooter and his network — and possibly offer clues about who might escalate from online hate to violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat did the alleged Pittsburgh shooter talk about on Gab, and with whom?\\n\\nWe used a custom API to scrape every post, reply and quote from every user on Gab, reaching back to the site’s launch in 2016. Our database includes all Gab posts, even those users subsequently deleted from the site. We used text-analysis methods in Python to analyze the massive volume of data.\\n\\nSince joining Gab in January 2018, Bowers contributed 998 posts and replies to others’ posts. With text analytics of his nearly 1,000 posts, replies and quotes, we found overwhelmingly anti-Semitic ideations.\\n\\nBower’s two most commonly used words were “kike” and “jew,” often associated with terms like “vile” and “degenerate,” and many other anti-Semitic references as well. For example, he frequently used the hashtag “#everysingletime,” referring to an alt-right Jewish conspiracy theory in which Jews are behind orchestrated efforts to attack white culture and values.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab has “groups” in which members with similar interests hold conversations. Many of Bowers’s posts were in these groups, especially the “Guns of Gab,” “Supremacy,” “Immigration” and “Anti-white” groups, which reinforced his interest in firearms and white-supremacist philosophy.\\n\\nBowers boasted about 600 friends and followers on Gab but was far less active than many in his network. Judging by the number of messages sent among members, Bowers was tightly connected with a select few members of this network and loosely connected with many.\\n\\nComparing Bowers to the typical Gab user\\n\\nWe compared Bowers’s activity and his social network to the larger Gab community. Our analysis suggests that while Bowers does not perfectly represent the rest of Gab’s members, substantial similarities exist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe gathered the 200 most commonly used hashtags on Gab to compare to Bowers’s. The hashtags included #altright and #whitegenocide, themes in Bowers’s posts. Bowers’s posts and the most popular Gab hashtags both included references to political conspiracy theories such as #qanon and #releasethememo.\\n\\nBut Bowers’s posts and replies differ in his nearly exclusive focus on anti-Semitic ideas. In the rare times he touched on other topics, those were general alt-right political discussions about white supremacy and related themes. The average Gab user was much more focused on general current political topics, with hashtags including #maga, #trump, #fakenews and #politics.\\n\\nThe larger network active on Gab\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab conversations are heavily laden with alt-right themes. As you can see in the illustration above, since 2016, one of the hashtags most commonly used on Gab has been #altright.\\n\\nOther common Gab hashtags from the same data set suggest broader anti-immigration themes, including #buildthewall, #bansharia and #banislam. These hashtags were among the most common in a set of more than 30 million posts — indicating that these sentiments are pervasive. As you can see, Gab also overflows with political conspiracy theory discussions, with such common hashtags as #pizzagate, #draintheswamp and #deepstate. Gun rights activism shows up in hashtags such as #2a and #nra.\\n\\nUsers have posted roughly 30 million comments on Gab since its 2016 launch. Below you can see that the volume of Gab activity by posts, replies and quotes has grown over time.\\n\\nWhite supremacy and anti-Semitism have endured in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League documented a 57 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents from 2016 to 2017. FBI hate crime statistics for 2016 show that more than half of faith-based crimes were against Jews.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, many expected the alt-right to retreat from physical gatherings and return to digital realms. Instead, alt-right gangs such as the Proud Boys, the Atomwaffen Division and their followers, have become bolder, engaging in street violence at rallies, bomb plots and killings.\\n\\nOur analyses show that Bowers is not alone in his hatred. Gab has roughly 450,000 users, and while many do not espouse anti-Semitism, a sizable number do and regularly connect online to share their ideology. Our analyses also show that these individuals are not difficult to find or monitor.\\n\\nThe challenge comes in knowing when they will escalate from online speech to real-world action.\\n\\nMatthew Phillips (@mdphill1_uncc) is an assistant professor of criminal justice and criminology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nArunkumar Bagavathi is a final-year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Having integrated tools for monitoring and troubleshooting performance of your voice and application traffic simultaneously is essential.\\nThe nGenius Solution leverages rich, actionable information to provide the visibility and control necessary for monitoring, troubleshooting, and planning for VoIP technologies both in the corporate LAN or across your MPLS WAN.\\n\\nThe VoIP management challenge\\nThe slowly maturing VoIP platform has enterprises taking a long look at this technology, and not just for cost savings. Many of these potential users are opting for in-house rather than service-provider solutions because of the additional savings, future flexibility, and a simple lack of consistent vision by the large telco providers.\\nThose adventurous souls who implement VoIP themselves face the daunting task of managing a voice-oriented data network. For network managers accustomed to data networks, this job requires a specialized toolkit.\\nTo determine the best option for the enterprise market, we gathered four VoIP testing contenders and turned them loose on the VoIP installations at our Advanced Network Computing Laboratory (ANCL) testing facility at the University of Hawaii.\\n\\nVoIP\\nManagementIt\\'s clear that VoIP technology is the future of telephony, making effective VoIP management the task of every telecom manager. As the convergence of voice and data networks raises new challenges, telecom managers are seeking new solutions. For example, VoIP technology has introduced a whole new set of security concerns. It is no longer just IT network administrators who have to worry about viruses and denial of service attacks. And because VoIP technology is usually added on to a legacy TDM system, voice networks are becoming much more complex to manage. That\\'s why telecom managers around the world are turning to SecureLogix for superior VoIP management solutions.\\n\\nBusiness communication and VoIP Management\\nNetwork management vendor NetIQ claims it has a way to answer the question a bit more definitively. Last month, the company announced two products, one that aims to give enterprises information before they deploy voice over IP (VOIP), the other to help manage VOIP systems as they go into pilot and, ultimately, full deployment.\\nThe first product is called VOIP Assessor. It\\'s a software package designed to let enterprises generate traffic loads that will imitate a full VOIP system\\'s traffic across the network. Such measurements provide information that can\\'t be gleaned from a pilot that simply uses an IP PBX and a few dozen IP phones, according to Steve Joyce, director of network technologies at NetIQ.\\n\\nThe Improve VoIP\\nManagementA successful voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployment requires careful consideration of and adequate planning for the system\\'s long-term management requirements. Your deployment and integration plans must identify the methods and technologies through which you will monitor, support, and maintain reliability across the VoIP network. Voice traffic is considerably more sensitive to network conditions than normal data traffic and your management plans account for this fact.\\nAlong with VoIP management\\'s technical requirements, your plan should also address potential personnel issues and functional task changes. Dedicated telecommunications personnel normally administer voice systems and conduct voice-specific tasks. As you integrate VoIP with the IP network, these responsibilities may be shifted to or shared with native data-networking staff.\\n\\nThe wake-up call for VoIP Management\\nService providers are beginning to recognize the importance of VoIP management as an important element of their long-term VoIP investment.\\nFor some carriers there is a true ?disconnect? between the two areas due to poor planning.\\nIn fact, recent discussions with enterprise telecom managers indicate that VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) and security are critical concerns that must be solved before large scale VoIP service adoption occurs. During the next three years, enterprises will assess their VoIP requirements including business need and impact, costs and technical staffing. Many will turn to outsourcing because of the high level of complexity. To seize this\\nopportunity, carriers must better understand the importance of managing VoIP.\\n\\nVOIP Management for BusinessesDespite promises of streamlined efficiency and ease of convergence, network managers are discovering that running voice calls over the data network is rarely simple.\\nTo help the growing number of businesses turning to IP telephony, vendors are adding functions to make VOIP (voice over IP) management easier, and they\\'re adding services for enterprises that can\\'t make VOIP work on their own.\\nAvaya Inc., which has been selling IP telephony systems for three years, this week at the VoiceCon conference in Orlando, Fla., will unveil its Enterprise Service Platform to give customers the option of letting the vendor remotely monitor the network on a subscription basis. Avaya\\'s Secure Intelligent Gateway connects the vendor\\'s network operations center to the customer\\'s site, providing a simultaneous view of voice and data streams.\\n\\nVoIP Solution and Target management Holes A study released last week shows that the growing adoption of VoIP service among enterprises is exposing \"critical weaknesses\" in the tools used to manage those networks. The report, called \"The VoIP Management Gap: Problems and Solutions,\" was published last week by Light Reading\\'s Enterprise VoIP Insider. It looks at the challenges of VoIP, including service-quality issues and the impact of sub-par management tools. The lack of such tools is motivating experienced data management vendors, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco, to move into the space via acquisition. These companies will be welcomed with open arms by customers that want to deploy VoIP networks with minimal performance hiccups, such as jitter, latency and packet loss.\\n\\nVoIP\\nPerformance ManagementThe banking industry is all about mitigating risk, and UMB Bank did just that with its recent VoIP implementation by adding a performance management system to the mix. The Kansas City, Mo.-based firm, with 150 banking centers throughout six states and approximately 3,500 employees, decided that a next-generation VoIP system would best suit its communications needs.\\nBill Taylor, assistant vice president and manager of network services at UMB Bank, said because its previous network infrastructure was aging and in need of replacement, the IT staff developed a strategy to provide its various locations with more reliable network service to support VoIP.\\nWe looked at legacy key and PBX systems, but quickly discovered there was no next generation for those products because everything was being developed around VoIP technology,\" he said. \"But we realized that to roll out a new voice system at these locations, we\\'d have to change our network\\narchitecture.',\n",

       " 'Have you heard that the Republican tax reform proposal is a sweetheart deal for \"the rich,\" and doesn\\'t help middle class Americans? Yes, you have. Liberals keep repeating it, and we keep debunking it -- over and over again. These claims largely stem from some combination of (a) ignorance of the facts, (b) a misleading focus on raw dollars versus percentages (of course wealthy taxpayers will receive more relief in terms of sheer dollars, as they shoulder -- by far -- the highest proportional and actual tax burden of any income cohort, and (c) cherry-picked data points from a distant, hypothetical and unlikely future in which Congress chooses to allow a giant tax hike on the middle class. In reality, the overwhelming majority of all middle class households will receive a tax cut under the GOP plan, and the rich don\\'t receive a disproportional benefit. Indeed, at the request of President Trump, House Republicans wrote their bill to exclude an income rate cut for the \"millionaires and billionaires\" Democrats so love to invoke. But that didn\\'t stop the Washington Post from once again claiming in a front page story that the Republican-crafted legislation had veered away from middle income earners in favor of the rich. The CATO Institute\\'s Chris Edwards swooped in with a detailed fact check, starting with a description of WaPo\\'s false premise:\\n\\nNews stories are portraying the Republican tax bills as favoring the rich, even though the opposite is true. The GOP cuts would make the tax code more progressive, and the largest percentage cuts would go to middle-income households. The Washington Post pushed another faulty narrative yesterday. The three layers of headlines on the hardcopy front page were, “Trump’s tax vow taking a U-turn—focus shifted away from middle class—GOP plan evolved into a windfall for the wealthy.” The story’s theme was that Trump originally promised middle-class tax cuts, but House and Senate tax bills have morphed into an orgy of tax cuts for corporations and rich people. Ridiculous.\\n\\nWhy \"ridiculous\"? Well, because the facts say so:\\n\\nRather than a “windfall for the wealthy” as the Post claims, the GOP bills would provide larger percentage cuts for middle earners than higher earners (see here and here). The GOP may abandon cutting the top individual tax rate at all. Much of the cuts for high earners are allocated corporate tax cuts, but economists disagree about who those cuts would actually benefit. Furthermore, the GOP tax bills would increase spending subsidies (refundable credits) for people at the bottom who do not pay any individual income taxes. Look at this TPC analysis of the Senate bill. It shows the bottom two quintiles receiving tax “cuts” in 2019 and 2025, yet those groups do not currently pay any income taxes on net...The following chart shows the TPC data in context. First, note the enormous share of federal taxes paid by the top quintile under current law. The chart includes all federal taxes—income, payroll, estate, and excise for 2019. Now observe that the top quintile would receive a smaller share of the Senate tax cut than their tax share under current law. For the three middle quintiles, it is the opposite. That means that the Senate tax cut would make the federal tax code more progressive. If the Senate tax cut is enacted, higher earners would pay a larger share of the overall federal tax burden.\\n\\nEdwards\\' analysis laments the fact that the GOP plan is too progressive and therefore insufficiently pro-growth, but despite those frustrations, he cannot abide supposedly objective journalists furnishing readers with the opposite of the truth. Here is the chart he mentions:\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that the top 20 percent pay close to 70 percent of all federal taxes (blue bars), but would receive just over 60 percent of the tax cut (red bars) under the Senate bill. For the bottom quintile -- who barely pay any federal taxes to begin with -- their share of the cuts would be (slightly) disproportionately small (which is not the same as a tax increase, mind you). As for the middle income earners in quintiles two, three and four? They all get disproportionately large tax cuts, on average, compared to their share of federal taxes paid. As Edwards writes, this is precisely the opposite of what the Washington Post told its readers. The data above, incidentally, comes from the left-leaning Tax Policy Center; other nonpartisan groups have offered even rosier projections about the GOP\\'s plans, across an array of metrics. When a Twitter skirmish broke out over WaPo\\'s conclusions yesterday, the Manhattan Institute\\'s Brian Riedl (whose work I cited in this post) further underscored Edwards\\' correct argument:\\n\\nDerek -- Per TPC\\n\\n\\n\\n--Bottom 80% of families currently pay 33% of all combined federal taxes, yet would get 37% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\n--Top 1% currently pays 27% of all federal taxes but would get just 18% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo tax code becomes MORE progressive. — Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) December 11, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMight the Post\\'s in-house fact-checker care to assign some Pinocchios to their own paper\\'s misleading headline and reporting?

Description of Related Art\\nIn integrated circuits there is a need to have a delay circuit to provide signal delays for various functions. Delay circuits can be found in internal clock generation for clock signals in a DRAM and in power supplies internal to semiconductor chips to control the timing of pump voltages. Setup and hold time is an important specification requiring the delay of signals for an asynchronous DRAM in controlling RAS, CAS, address and data and in a synchronous DRAM for producing the various clocks and controlling data and address.\\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,626 (Inoue) is shown a delay circuit for internal clock generation. This invention uses an RC network with a cross coupled nor gate as a single shot multivibrator. A MOS transistor is used as a resistor so that the resistance can vary with changes in the power supply and the capacitor is across the input of an inverter stage to vary the trip point with threshold voltage.\\nA power supply internal to an integrated circuit is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,000 (Buskirk et al.) and uses an RC network in conjunction with a Schmitt trigger to produce a delay circuit to control a pump gate for supplying regulated power to the drains of flash EEPROM memory cells. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,026 (Cleveland et al.) shows a delay circuit using an RC network in conjunction with a Schmitt trigger for use with pump gates for an internal power supply providing power to the gates of a flash EEPROM memory cells.\\nIn all cases the delay circuits provide only one RC combination for use in any one delay circuit. Thus the delay of the rising and falling transitions of a signal are controlled with the same delay. A wide variation of rising and falling delays and differences in trigger points results in unbalanced signals. This makes it difficult to achieve set up and hold for all cases in the production of a product. A delay circuit with separate delay control of the rising and falling transitions is needed to overcome the wide variations in delay between rising and falling transitions.',\n",

The Rockies are going for a four game sweep. These Rockies were 18 games under .500 before this series started. They’d been on a 4 game losing streak and had scored 2 runs total in those four games. Today, they can sweep us in a four game series.—Aaron Cook is the Rockies’ best pitcher. He’s a lot better than Glendon Rusch and Jorge De La Rosa, who we scored 3 combined runs against. Cook pitched 3 Houdini-like innings late in the All Star game to keep it tied.—By comparison, Zach Duke starts for us. Duke’s been slowly falling away from the consistent, improved pitcher we were seeing at the start of the year. His last start was very bad and Coors Field is not an ideal place for him to pitch. However, he’s 2-0, 2.77 vs. the Rockies in his career. Go figure.—The Bucs need a win today (they haven’t won in a calendar week), but the ESPN.com/Accuscore prediction thing somehow has the Rox at a remarkable 69% favorite.

       " 'An Indian Love Story\\n\\nAn Indian Love Story is a one-reel silent short film about personal relationships in a Native American community. The film is about two married couples, each of the partners of which are involved with the spouse of the other couple, a former lover. It is a western drama released in 1911 and directed by Fred J. Balshofer and was produced by Bison (a brand name under the New York Motion Picture Company). It was also titled An Indian Love Affair.\\n\\nThis film is one of the many films that claims to have utilized Native American actors, although Mona Darkfeather\\'s heritage is not entirely clear. The description of the story in Moving Picture World said that no white people appeared as characters in the story\\'s contest and didn\\'t clarify whether the cast included only Native Americans. Previously, Lillian St. Cyr, a Winnebago Indian, had appeared in Kalem\\'s The White Squaw and Lubin\\'s The Falling Arrow.\\n\\nPlot\\nAn Indian Love Story surrounds two couples who are in unhappy relationships. Two main characters, Deerheart and Mona (played by Mona Darkfeather), are partners. Another character, Dove Eye, is in love with Deerheart, even though Eagle Wing is hopelessly in love with her. A quadrangle is formed among the characters that are unhappy and dissatisfied with their relationships. The men fight for the women they desire through a series of events. Deerheart almost gets executed at the stake due to a misunderstanding by Dove Eye\\'s father. Dove Eye decides that because of the encounter with her father, she was never fit for Deerheart\\'s love. She then turns to Eagle Wing. Deerheart is released and is returned to Mona.\\n\\nCast \\n Mona Darkfeather - Mona\\n Dove Eye as Dove Eye - Mona\\'s Rival\\n Chief Eagle Wing as Eagle Wing - Dove Eye\\'s Admirer (as Eagle Wing)\\n\\nProduction\\nAn Indian Love Story was requested to be released early by the educational films corporation. The film is a western drama produced by Bison and released on August 18, 1911. The film is an integration of story, scenery, and Native American characters. A suggestion was made that the Native Americans were of Crow Indian descent and resided on their Wyoming reservation. But in 1911, Bison was in southern California and filmed this story in or near Los Angeles and used local actors from their own stock company. The film producers requested that the actors be as realistic as possible and be aware of Native American customs. It is unclear whether the cast consisted of only Indian actors. The film is one of the many early films about two Native American couples swapping partners.\\n\\nCasting\\nEven before An Indian Love Story, both Indian and white actors were cast to represent Native Americans in films. But Indians did not believe that the white actors reproduced the Indian lifestyle accurately and accused films of false portrayal of Indians. Native Americans protested and claimed that only Indians should play the roles of Indians. Bison\\'s Indian films occasionally consisted of Indian actors and their stories showed the \"noble savage and condemned the hostile warrior\", although they were not the only studio to do so.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAleiss, Angela.

Rice allegedly answered the request with a \"Fuck off.\" Thompson is said to have responded by taking a swing at Rice, but he didn\\'t connect.\\n\\nRice told investigators he didn\\'t retaliate at that time, but he expressed umbrage at Thompson supposedly \"asking kids for money or drugs,\" the Sentinel reports.\\n\\nThen, on August 14, Rice was with his roommate when he saw Thompson outside a Chase bank not far from the intersection of East Quincy Avenue and South Buckley Road.

But Rice reportedly said that after the initial blow, he hit Thompson again as he lay prone and said, \"Stay away from here and stay out of the neighborhood.\"\\n\\nThompson did, but not by choice. He lingered on life support for about six weeks before dying in late September.

A leased vehicle has to be repaired by the lessee, but when the vehicle is returned to the dealer, the reduced value on account of the accident is a cost to the lessor.

       " 'For the first time since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iran is on the verge of acquiring a direct land link to the Mediterranean Sea and southern Lebanon. Iranian proxies and Assad regime forces advanced south in the Syrian desert on Friday to reach the Syrian-Iraqi border, cutting off Free Syrian Army rebels who had hoped to traverse that same territory to fight ISIS in the east.\\n\\nBarring a Pentagon-backed rebel counterattack, Iranian proxies are now on pace to complete their corridor through a combination of advances south on the Iraqi side of the border and advances north and east on the Syrian side. On the Iraqi side, Iran-linked Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) groups reached the border in a lightning offensive last month. The Institute for the Study of War records that before the offensive, PMF groups had already attained a direct line of control from the Iran-Iraq border to Tel Afar – their forward position on the eve of the lightning offensive.\\n\\nNow, a similar lightning offensive has occurred on the Syrian side of the border. The Iranian pro-regime media station Tasnim News released multiple photos today from the Syrian-Iraqi border showing IRGC-Quds Force head Qassem Suleimani alongside members of the Fatimiyun Brigade, which is a force of Afghani foreign fighters in Syria backed by the IRGC. Iranian-backed militias from Iraq including the Imam Ali Battalions, the Imam Baqir Brigade, and the Jihad Brigades had all increased their presence in the Syrian desert in the weeks prior to last Friday’s advance.\\n\\nWhile many miles still separate the Iran-backed militias’ in northeastern Iraq and southwestern Syria, the militias are highly likely to link up if only ISIS-held territory stands in their way. Iranian and Assad regime forces were able to make rapid gains against ISIS in the Aleppo suburbs after boxing in rebel forces in the area of Al-Bab town. This past Friday, rebel forces in the Syrian desert might have been boxed in in a similar fashion.\\n\\nIt is important to note that pro-Assad forces launched few operations in the south Syrian desert until Free Syrian Army rebels began making gains against ISIS in the area this March and April. Assad forces then declared the area a priority – but they and their Iran-backed allies attacked the FSA rebels, not ISIS. Furthermore, pro-Assad attacks against rebel forces only began in earnest as the Russian “de-escalation zones” initiative took effect. Iranian Quds Force head Suleimani reportedly urged his proxies to build a ground corridor “before the Americans get there” around this time.\\n\\nShlomo Bolts is the policy and advocacy officer at the Syrian American Council in Washington D.C., where he prepares analysis and presentations regarding the ground situation inside Syria to facilitate policy papers, reports, op-eds and briefings with senior officials in the government and Congress.\\n\\n[Photo: Tasnim News]',\n",

We aimed to understand the attitudes, beliefs, preferences and values of patients who refused creation or use of an AVF. With qualitative methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 HD patients (Canada, 2009), who previously refused creation or use of an AVF. Three independent analysts reviewed interview transcripts. We discovered three main themes that impacted the decision to refuse a fistula: (i) poor previous personal or vicarious experiences with the fistula, including cannulation, bleeding, time commitment and appearance; (ii) knowledge transfer and informed decision making. Patients identified information from other patients to be as important as information from health care workers, that information on vascular access (VA) was presented but not understood and that timing of information was crucial with information overload at the start of dialysis and (iii) maintenance of status quo and outlook on life. Some patients stated they live day-to-day without being influenced by the mortality risks with a catheter. AVF refusal is multifactorial and depends on individual patients. Although nephrologists consider the fistula to be the optimal VA, patients do not think in the same terms of reducing infection rates but focus on the practical day-to-day use of their VA and its influence on their quality of life and future outlook.',\n",

Its incidence is increasing, from 0.5% in the sixties to 1-5% of all thyroid neoplasms today. The diagnosis of such neoplasms is not always straightforward. In fact, it is often the result of pathologic findings on a gland resected for an apparently benign disease. Surgical dissection may prove more complicated than in standard cases of thyroidectomy for the possible tight adhesions existing between the gland's capsule and the surrounding structures. In cases of capsular infiltration, postoperative external local radiotherapy is indicated. A retrospective observational analysis was performed to establish whether patients with incidental thyroid lymphomas who underwent total thyroidectomy for another pathology had major surgical complications and worse prognostic results than patients with an accurate preoperative diagnosis. Six cases of thyroid lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed: 4 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 2 MALT lymphomas. Of these, 2 were correctly preoperatively identified by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and 4 were an unexpected finding at histology: 3 cases of total thyroidectomy carried out for huge hypothyroid goiter in patients affected by Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in 1 case of total thyroidectomy carried out for anaplastic carcinoma in a patient affected by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In our experience, a correct preoperative diagnosis was extremely difficult (33%). In patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration, a correct diagnosis was made in 66% of cases.

This appointment comes as Chris McWilton announced he will leave MasterCard on December 31.\\n\\nMcWilton joined MasterCard in 2003 as corporate controller and was appointed chief financial officer in October of the same year. As CFO, McWilton played a critical role in the company’s successful initial public offering (IPO) in May 2006. The MasterCard IPO was the largest domestic IPO of 2006 and the 12th largest domestic IPO in U.S. history at the time.\\n\\nHe was named president of MasterCard Global Accounts in 2007, managing relationships for the company’s largest customers. He was then appointed president of U.S. Markets in 2009, before assuming North American responsibilities in 2013.\\n\\nPrior to joining MasterCard, McWilton had a 22-year career with KPMG, where he specialized in financial and SEC reporting and was an SEC reviewing partner.\\n\\n“I want to acknowledge Chris’s contributions to the growth and evolution of MasterCard,” said Ajay Banga, president and chief executive officer, MasterCard. “I’d also like to personally thank him for his commitment over the years in helping to make our company what it is today. The entire company joins me in wishing Chris and his family all the best going forward.”\\n\\nAs president, North America Markets, Vosburg will oversee the company’s customer-facing activities in the United\\nStates and Canada, including sales, business development, strategy and relationship management with issuers, merchants, governments and acquirers. He will join the company’s Executive Committee.\\n\\nVosburg, 48, was most recently the company’s chief product officer, a role he held since April 1, 2014. In this role, he led the development, commercialization and management of the company’s global Core Products offerings which include consumer credit and debit, commercial, prepaid and loyalty solutions.\\n\\n“I’m pleased to announce Craig’s appointment. His experience, both global and domestic, make him the ideal person to drive our business forward,” said Banga. “I’m confident Craig will have great success in his new role.”\\n\\nVosburg brings global experience to the role gained through a decade of working in the Asia Pacific region with MasterCard and earlier in his career with Bain & Company and A.T. Kearney.\\n\\nVosburg joined MasterCard in 2006 as head of MasterCard Advisors in Southeast Asia, Greater China, and South Asia/Middle East/Africa. In 2008, he was named managing director of the MasterCard Advisors business in the U.S. and Canada. In 2010, Vosburg was named group executive, U.S. Market Development, responsible for managing and building relationships within the merchant and acquiring community.\\n\\nHe began his career working in commercial banking at CoreStates Financial Corporation.\\n\\nVosburg is a past David Rockefeller Fellow at the Partnership for New York City and currently sits on the Board of Directors of the New York Botanical Garden. He holds a Master of Business Administration from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Bucknell University.\\n\\nChanges to Global Product and Middle East and Africa Leadership\\n\\nEffective January 1, Michael Miebach will assume the role of chief product officer for the company, replacing Vosburg, and will be based in New York. He currently serves as president, Middle East and Africa, responsible for driving the evolution of payments and delivering increased value to MasterCard stakeholders in markets across the region.\\n\\nBefore joining MasterCard in 2010, Miebach held several global positions including with Barclays, where he was the managing director for Middle East and North Africa and managing director for Barclays Africa. He also held senior-level positions at Citibank, responsible for Germany, Austria, UK and Turkey.\\n\\nRaghu Malhotra will become president, Middle East and Africa as of January 1. Previously overseeing Middle East and North Africa, Malhotra will now add supervision of sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa markets to his responsibilities.\\n\\nSince 2000, he has led several teams across South Asia, India and the Middle East and Africa.

How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought ``What better than Wikipedia?`` Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article?

Duh, that's what happens in Discussion pages about religious denominations and political candidacies. Your action and your comments here are almost astute, but not quite: The article about Temple Lot was created by a member of the Temple Lot faction, Jared Smith, and and has been constructively edited by his older brother Jordan Smith, who is also an active member of the Temple Lot faction. Not a ``former member`` or an ``excommunicated`` member, but a full baptised member, ``in good standing`` according to the bylaws and official documentation both within and outside the faction. Due mainly to the machinations and malice of an anonymous editor, Good Ol'factory (whom you know perfectly well is the same as the Snocrates/Zoporific who began unconstructively editing the Temple Lot articles in December 2007), both Temle Lot members/Wikipedia Editors Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have been unfairly and abusively banned from editing Wikipedia. Specifically, Administrator Versageek banned Jordan Smith on December 17, 2007 because he kept complaining about Snocrates/Good Ol'factory's misconduct, and then when Snocrates-turned  Good Ol'factory was finally granted administrative privileges, he deleted jsmith51389's user page, which contained a clear explanation of what had happened in December 2007. Duh, that's what dishonest persons do, to hide their misconduct from review: they censor it. I'm mildly curious what pompous and unreasonable and unfair and abusive reply or action you will come up with in reply here, but I'm not terribly curious, seeing as how it's rather predictable whatever pompous, self-rightous ``authorities`` do when their misconduct is brought to light: Slander the person or persons who bring the misconduct to light, that's what they do.  Nice try, but no cigar, sir. The truth about the Latter-day Saint Movement, and the fascinating role Hedrickites such as Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have played in it, will come to light, whether you, or Snocrates/Good Ol'Factory or any other pious geek, wishes otherwise. Ironically, many issues played out on this discussion page in the past few days, and before, are issues which played out in the Free Speech Movement, I don't reckon you're familiar with that.

As long as I don\\'t start other applications that use the GPU, folding@home works fine, always. Also it always goes wrong when those applications are starting up, not while they are already running.

The problem with that request I think is the effectiveness of that solution, if all eue\\'s would run the last frame again, that\\'s also duplicate work, and since the system to check eue\\'s is now in place with reassigning the work unit to another donor replacing it with another one would need to be backed up by strong evidence of increased efficiency.\\n\\nIf you eue\\'d at a high percentage, there is something to be said for retrying the last frame, saving the time to get to that percentage on another donor\\'s system. But, time has shown that one particular system can eue at a fixed percentage when another will complete the unit without problems, reassigning the work unit to another donor stays a necessity therefore.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to dismiss the suggestion though, if there were abundant resources to spend on improving the clients and server code I would think it\\'s not a bad idea to retry a frame in certain conditions ( not the first frame for instance ) before returning it to Stanford with an eue report. Since the resources are limited, focus should be applied on things with the highest efficiency increases, I\\'m not sure where this would rank since it\\'s not a win win situation. In some/most cases, the frame would eue even when being repeated, waisting time before the wu is assigned to another donor, slowing the whole chain of generations.\\n\\nIf there is something with my computer that prevents a certain work unit from finishing no matter what, then the retry would still cost only a few minutes of extra work, compared to hours of extra work if it is sent to 2 other computers. I now understand what the downsides of this could be.\\n\\nI think it\\'s after all more efficient for me to not pause the client. If I paused the client every time that would easily make a difference of 4 less work units finished per day. That one work unit per week (or something like that) that crashes doesn\\'t make up for that.\\n\\nMany studies of the reliability of CPUs have been done and results published. One study of the reliability of GPUs was completed by Stanford and the paper was published. These are very important considerations needed to back up the computational methods used by FAH.\\n\\nStable computers will produce the same result if you give it the same set of calculations to be repeated. What you\\'re asking for is for science to accept results from unstable computers. No reputable scientist will trust results from unstable computers and as a consequence, Stanford does not condone/support overclocking. They can\\'t prevent you from doing it but they can insist that your hardware be inherently reliable.\\n\\nThey have no control over why your system fails, whether the failure was caused by bad hardware, by bad drivers, by overclocking, by a fault in some other program or by some unknown factor. They do have control over the results that are acceptable to their studies. The answer is pretty simple: bad results will be discarded.\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t overclock... Its the gpu\\'s inability to perfectly switch from one graphics task to another. So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nYou are wanting more efficiency, but what if youre idea happens. A gpu fails and restarts, but this btime the error isn\\'t caught. 2 months from now, the error is noticed. By then that minor glitch has propegated through the subsequent runs making all that work invalid and 2 wasted months of work. Where if the units dropped and resent to someone else, the project is not injepordy and an average of 2-3hrs is missed.\\n\\nIf youre all for science, this minor slow down is well worth the effect.\\n\\npatonb wrote:The problem isn\\'t overclock...

So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nEven if we assume, as you have probably done, that the problem in inherent in the GPU\\'s hardware, it\\'s up to the drivers to resolve conflicts so I\\'d guess that someday a future version of the drivers will someday resolve this sort of issue. The fundamental problem is lack of repeatability, though, because those who write drivers are unlikely to ever see this failure in their testing. In any case, be sure to report the problem on the GPU\\'s home website.\\n\\nAre you still running the Nvidia 8800 GTS that\\'s listed in your profile?

For some, the condom moment in a relationship is the first time ever a couple experiences flesh on flesh in the most private of areas. Go off condoms? Whaa? You mean I can stick my dick in there and come out alive?\\n\\nBut there comes a time in most serious relationships when you face an ethical and moral dilemma: to condom or not to condom. This usually happens when there’s a penis involved (most of my gals-who-like-gals pals admit to forgoing dental dams and other barriers).\\n\\nA few years ago, one of my colleagues suggested I write a column about deciding to drop condoms. As a columnist who strove to entertain and to promote safer sex, I politely declined. Besides, I always used condoms, silly! That was before my relationship got serious. Like pee-in-the-same-room serious.\\n\\nCouples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms for a partner’s health/safetyBut now I know. Deciding to drop condoms marks a moment of trust in your partner…you trust that he won’t give you HIV, HPV, or the clap. You both have accurate and current test results, and you’re not lying about them either. If you’re a straight couple, the male half has to trust that she’s always going to be reliable us using her pill/ring/patch, because, for some, babies can be even worse than STIs.\\n\\nThere are gradients of safer sex, and sometimes condoms don’t factor into the safer sex you’re having. And that’s okay as long as you’ve got your bases covered.\\n\\n1. Some form and extent of exclusivity\\n2. STI testing, with presumably acceptable results\\n3. Certain length of time together, which varies\\n4. Reliable contraception for hetero couplings\\n\\nIt’s hard for these younger types (i.e. people like me) to accept that condomless sex is not morally wrong. I already feel like I’m treading in deplorable sex column behavior here. I’m endangering the public good!\\n\\nBut, as I previously mentioned, it all boils down to trust. A trust in healthy sex.\\n\\nWith condoms as effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies and transmission of certain STIs as they are, it’s a privilege for couples to step back to au naturel. You’ve got to plan and perhaps pay extra for birth control. It takes an incredible amount of responsibility to carefully cross the condomless border because–let’s face it–not everyone can do it or do it right. Most importantly, couples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms because of a contraceptive misstep or simply for a partner’s sanity/health/safety.\\n\\nSo, sure, use a condom every time. But if this time is your 60th time with your longterm partner and neither of you is boning anyone else etc. etc., maybe you don’t have to drop a buck every time you f–ahem, engage in coitus.',\n",

When Godinez cried out that he was Mexican, the jeering reportedly turned to racial slurs like “spic” and “wetback.” According to his testimony, “The best way I can describe it is the sound of people chanting in a soccer stadium,” adding that Keenan was “laughing, smiling, and having a good time, while I could have died that day.”\\n\\nThe judge ruled that both men would be held for trial on felony charges of aggravated assault and conspiracy, along with several misdemeanors. This will be far from Keenan’s first time in legal jeopardy. As part of the “Love Park 4,” Keenan was charged with criminal conspiracy, institutional vandalism, resisting arrest, and criminal mischief.\\n\\nAt the time, Keenan only pleaded guilty to “disorderly conduct,” and the remaining charges were withdrawn.

       " 'JORDAN. A new fresh parenting online platform that features advice about pregnancy, child development and related topics, is getting attention from mothers in the Arab world.\\n\\n360Moms was launched a year ago collaborating with some of the best experts in the world to publish original high quality content, and is the first Arab website to share real life stories of mothers to inspire and give hope. In addition, it has a special Q&A section for moms to get quick answers on any parenting and health question.\\n\\nThe site already has 25,000 monthly users from all over the Arab world, and has over 50,000 followers on social media. The site was called by some mothers as: “A much needed platform” and “an everyday inspiration”.\\n\\nDina Abdul Majeed, the founder who is a mother herself to two little boys, had a 13-year career before starting 360Moms. She was previously the Head of the creative team at Yahoo Middle East and Africa. She started the platform because she found a big gap in parenting and health content in the Arab region.\\n\\nShe explains: “The inspiration that made me start this project was my own experience, I had a challenge regarding parenting my two kids, and two experts (that are now part of 360Moms experts team) helped me with my problem and saved me! I couldn’t find an online parenting platform to give me instant answers, I decided at that time that I wanted to spread the best updated knowledge to every mom to support and help her. Sometimes a few tips from experts can make all the difference in the world for a mom.”\\n\\nPhoto Caption: Dina Abdul Majeed, the founder of 360Moms\\n\\nThe platform also believes in personal involvement with their users, and organize monthly workshops about parenting and health topics to all parents.\\n\\nAnd this is only the beginning, its long term vision is to build a connected and empowered community of parents in the Arab world, to inspire them into building thriving generations.',\n",

       " 'Getting Some Sick is was a previously thought to be a commonly unknown illness, which was later linked to Unit 731, which can affect anyone, but is more likely to appear if one is an overweight, homosexual male. It also seems to afflict teachers more often due to their exposure to hundreds of students a day. It is also known to afflict neocons like Larry Craig while in public bathrooms, and give them \"Happy Feet\". It is also known a GAIDS, GayAIDS, or the Gay Virus. Anyone who gets infected with it becomes GAY GAY GAY GAY!\\n\\nContents\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe first sign of Getting Some Sick is Getting Some Nausea. Vomiting typically does not accompany the nausea, but in rare cases patients were Blowing Some Chunks.\\nThe second sign is Getting Some Migraine. This includes sensitivity to light, sound, and common sense. Typically the pain is felt in the temple area.\\nThe final and most elusive sign of Getting Some Sick is Getting Some Delirium. Patients typically experience hallucination, which leads to word salad. The only problem with this is that sometimes the patients are just weird.\\nOther symptoms include nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea. After that the person infected with it becomes GAY GAY GAY GAY!\\n\\nDocumented Cases\\n\\nA manifestation of some sick.\\n\\nThe first documented case of Get Some Sick is that of Mr. Winkler, a seventh-grade teacher. He assigned students a reference book to read dealing with homosexuality, and one child refused to read it. Winkler had no choice but to fail the student. Unbeknownst to him, the child was a master of voodoo and had political ties with the Ku Klux Klan which later provided him with the reaserch on the Get Some Sick Virus, and he willed the illness upon Winkler.\\nIt took four doctors 42 hours to find out what was wrong with him, but finally they Got Some Germ and discovered a new type of archebacteria in Winkler\\'s testicle. They were able to administer a new type of antibiotic to cure him of the condition. It was first discovered by Dr. House after he confused it for Lupus.\\n\\nThe second documented case of Get Some Sick is that of Larry Craig who caught it in an airport public bathroom and forgot his antibiotic shots and started to have \"Happy Feet\" and was accused of being Gay by an undercover Police Officer in the stall next to his. Larry Craig is still in denial about this.\\n\\nCures\\n\\nA vaccine has been created for the illness, in the form of Getting Some Shot In The Arm With A Really Huge Needle. The patient must be injected with the vaccine in the upper arm with a 14-inch needle. Do not be alarmed when it goes clear through his/her arm- this is normal. Swelling and itching at the injection site may occur, but it is worth it because Getting Some Sick is worse than anything else! It is the worst thing ever! It is so bad!

Living in Vermont, I usually vote democratic, but since in such a small state we get to know candidates, sometimes I (we) vote for the republican. But republicans here are republicans: balanced budgets and spending, eliminating inane regulations. But this time is different. I could quickly accept Reagan, Bush I, even Bush II and Nixon -- because I then felt they were basically good people. But with Donald, I feel uncertain, not knowing what the barrages of tweets might mean, what agenda if any is at work, fearing that DT wants actually to hurt people. Sometimes I think President Trump is like the uncle Donny who graces every family, who says mean-spirited things, and whom the rest of the family ignores: \"It\\'s just Uncle Donny.\" But then I recall he is the elected president and then I can\\'t get used to all the bluster and lies.

       " '`  == Nude beach & controversy ==  In using the terms I have used in writing and revising this part of this article, I have sought to improve the article for the widest reading audience. I do believe the words I chose when writing this part do serve that end better than some of the changes another keeps making. All opinions are of equal value in Wikipedia, including this part of the article about a legal controversy, even if I feel that I bring to the table both an English degree and a Juris Doctor.  I have learned in my experience that some legal terms (e.g., ``upheld`` being misunderstood understood to mean ``held up,” rather than being more correctly understood  as an action more akin to ``approving`` a lower court’s decision) can be confusing to all levels of readers,  intelligent well-educated  readers and average readers alike. Yet, on the other hand, one does not want to completely avoid the use the accurate legal terms for those readers who understand and appreciate their use.    This is why I have used parentheses and the like to clarify or expand upon some terms.`',\n",

    "## Document embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "A much more nuanced way to represent text is through embeddings. However, most machine learning models require a fixed-size input, so we need to find a way to represent the whole document as a fixed-size vector. One way to do this is to use the average of the word embeddings of the words in the document. We will use the pre-trained word embeddings from the GloVe model. However, using word embeddings requires us to split the documents into individual words. We will use the nltk library to do this, but there are both simpler and more advanced ways to do this. The simplest method would be to split the documents by spaces, while a more advanced method would be to use a tokenizer that is aware of the structure of the language, like the one in the [spacy](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer) library."
